==========
 Rapa Nui
==========

Once upon a time there was a team of stone masons who carved out a
giant block of rock from the volcanic tuff on the side of an extinct
volcano.

A second team carved a similar block.

Once the blocks were complete, with carved heads and a rounded front
edge, the rock underneath the horizontal moai was carved away in such
a way that the Moai was able to tile and rise under its own weight.

Balance is critical here.  First make it so the giant block is nearly
tipping, then make it oscillate like a tiny pendulum.

A second Moai placed close and made to oscillate at the same frequency
will then resonate in harmony with the first.

Once upright, they will walk down the hill together.

The key is that the two Moai are in resonance, the gravitational waves
one sends out being in harmony with the other.   As one sways, so does
the other in an equal and opposite motion.

They may start to circle each other.

To keep the motion going, a source of energy is required.   The Moai
start at the top of the hill and slowly walk down it, earth's
gravitational field supplying the energy.

Easter Island is where it is because it is at the centre of a giant
rotating magnetic storm on planet earth.

The rock of the Moai likely contain significant quantities of iron,
rocks that can hold a magnetic field.

This may be a key to how the Moai can rock and resonate without that
resonance building to the point that they topple.

Now, since the Moai are in effect giant magnets, the earth's magnetic
field will tend to push them back upright.  If you move a magnet
through a magnetic field, that field resists the movement and an
electric current is generated.  If the electric current is exactly the
right size to create an equal and opposite force to the movement, then
the Moai will simply rock like a pendulum.

Around each Moai, a standing wave will form.  This standing wave turns
the Moai into a giant rocking pendulum trapped in the fabric of space
time.

As more Moai are created and set on their journey of walking down to
their resting place on the ahu platforms, the Moai will resonate in
harmony.

At a certain density of Moai, this resonance will be so strong, the
wave produced will make it impossible to add another Moai to the
system.

The Moai might start to rock gently, but the oscillations will
increase over time and eventually it will topple.

To the people of Rapa Nui, this all must have seemed like magic, a
special power, or Mana.

The people will have learnt that certain times of the year there is a
greater probability of a new Moai staying stable.

Archaeologist are fond of creating narratives that fit with the
artifacts they discover.

The best narratives, the ones that are in fact the true story, lead to
other discoveries.

This account is one such narrative.

It is hard to imagine that the people would not have had great
ceremonies when a Moai was ready to be launched.   Maybe they were
always launched at full moon, at certain times of the year?


And this leads to the mysterious *rongorongo* writings that have been
discovered.

Messages etched onto special wood used for writing.   This is not just
old envelopes onto which you scribble a shopping list, rather
expensive, hard to obtain writing paper.

What was most important to the people of Rapa Nui?   The records of
the Moai's walks down to the coast.  The ones that walked, the ones
that fell.

The ahu are just platforms build to help bring a Moai to rest at a
place where it can strengthen the Mana of the island.

Perhaps the *ahu* are at places where Moai came to rest.   Later,
perhaps after a storm they may have started to walk again.

A well constructed *ahu* should have a gentle upward slope, so the
Moai can slowly lose its forward momentum.

Moai will spin as they walk.  This turns them into giant, slowly
revolving gyroscopes.

The spin itself leads to stability, because of the law of conservation
of angular momentum, which is just a corollary to the law of
conservation of momentum, which itself is just a fundamental property
of gravitational fields.

The slight asymetry in the Moai, due to the carving of heads has the
wonderful property that Moai are statistically much more likely to
come to rest facing inland than facing out to sea.

My father studied geography, he always used to say, "geography is why
are things where they are?.   History is why did things happen when
they did.".

The answer to both is physics, the laws of nature.

There is one law.  Nature strives to achieve local and global harmony.

It is all in the mathematics, all in the pie.

The Moai are where they are because Rapa Nui is bang slap in the
middle of the pacific.   It is one of the hubs around which the world
revolves.

As such, it does not feel the shocks that hit other parts of the
world.

Bermuda is a similar point, around which storms revolve.   It is all
in the physics.

So it may well be that outside of Rapa Nui the world is rarely stable
enough to get a Moai launched.

Once launched, like a quantum of energy they go on their way until
some force or momentum or (ahu) stops them.

Or until they achieve a place where they are in perfect harmony with
the universe itself.

The first Moai?
===============

Giant's Cauesway in Northern Ireland has beautiful hexagonal pillars
of basalt.

As the volcano was eroded by rain and wind, maybe Rapa Nui had pillars
that just walked down to the sea.

Maybe the giant's causeway in Ireland is actually marching into the
sea?

The magnetic field in Rapa Nui will be very stable, it may be the only
place on earth where this could happen.

So the Moai were there when the humans arrived and the humans just
decorated them?  And then learnt how to build new ones.

Or maybe when humans got there they found columns of basalt, lying on
the ground all over the place.

Like *eratic* boulders in glaciated areas.

They stood a couple of the columns up, and they walked down the hill
together.

Which came first?  The Moai or the humans?

Too many Moai?
==============

As the Moai go off on their walks and find their place of resting on
the island, the magnetic field around the island will strive to be in
harmony with the magnetic fields of the Moai.

The whole island will resonate with magnetic and gravitational fields
marching to the beat of the Moai.

As more and more Moai are created the strength of this field will
increase.

Launching a new Moai will become increasingly difficult.

Since each Moai is a giant magnet it will naturally want to oscillate
in time with the field created by the other Moai.

At some point this resonance will have sufficient energy to topple any 
new Moai.

To launch a Moai the amplitude of its oscillations need to be large
enough to cause it to wobble and waddle like a penguin, but not so
large that it topples over.

As it wobbles, the island's magnetic and gravitational fields act like
the forcer of a pendulum, giving just enough new energy for each
oscillation to replace energy dissipated as heat, due to things such
as friction.

If these are out of balance, the Moai will either stop rocking or
topple.

There is a tiny sweet spot at which they will just march down the
hill.

This sweet spot gets smaller as more Moai are added, since the
resonance in the magnetic and gravitational fields also get stronger.

The location of Rapa Nui itself helps increase the size of the sweet
spot, being a Lagrangian point about which the earth's fields revolve.

In fact, this is why there was a volcano at this spot in the first
place.  And the presence of the volcano was what provided rocks with a
strong magnetic field.

Now the Rapa Nui people no doubt developed a lot of myth and
superstition around the Moai, developing complex rituals for the
launching of a new Moai.

If something was done differently and the Moai toppled that practice
might stop, if the Moai walked then the new change would likely be
added to the ritual.

Since the walking of the Moai was associated with a mystical power or
*mana*, it is not difficult to imagine how the Moai would become of
such fundamental importance to the people.

A giant electric motor
======================

It seems most of the Moai were carved out of the rock in a horizontal
position.

Hence when turned through 90 degrees and stood upright, any magnetic
field that the rock had will now be 90 degrees out of phase with the
surrounding field.

This is the ideal orientation.

Hence the standing Moai can be thought of as the coils of a giant
electric motor, driven by the island's magnetic field.

Sea level changes
=================

At times in the past much of Rapa Nui has been underwater.
Certainly, sea level has been much higher than it currently is.

Undersea columns of harder rock may have been eroded by the sea.

It is much, much easier to *launch* a Moai undersea, due to the
greater density of water to air.

Perhaps this is how the first Moai were launched.

The *Yonaguni* structure off the island of Taiwan in fract has two
natural columns that rise to just 2.5m below the sea surface.

Note that *Yonaguni* is 100 miles off the coast of Taiwan.  It appears
to be in a location that, like Rapa Nui, is one of the Lagrangian
points around which the earth's fields rotate.

This shows that such natural structures can indeed be formed.

Hence, one intriguing theory is that the Moai first walked under the
sea.

Once an upright Moai is in a stable oscillation it could easily stay
upright as the sea level lowered, especially if there are multiple
such columns in resonance with each other.

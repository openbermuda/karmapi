There are a lot of questions in karma pi land.

Not so many answers, but some hints at experiments that could help give
better insights.

It is a land of doubt and much mystery.


On the software side there is exploration of ideas to help share data,
resources and ideas.

How to do this balancing privacy against benefits of open sharing?

How to better understand how much we are sharing and with who?

Karma Pi makes no attempt to be secure.  Rather, it is assumed
processes anywhere on the local network are acting in good faith, and
in so doing make better use of the available resources.

So for instance, a classroom working with raspberry pi's.  Maybe
trying to make a weather forecast, but the pieces of the puzzle are
spread across the space.  Forage for clues and other's with answers to
questions you had not even thought to ask?  Someone who has been
watching the snow, rain and ice each day, the height of the tide or
the phase of the moon?

The *karmapi.kiss* module is a simple start to sharing data across
pi's.

And there is *yosser* if you want to share in the work.

But there is also this, I learned today, thanks to Peter Wang, and no
doubt many others::

**Blockchain** too, in this case addressing data integrity and
security too.

Trying not to re-invent wheels, finding others that are solving the
same problems and working together was always a goal.

So *karmapi.kiss* or time to explore the **ocean**?

*Ocean Protocol* logo appears to be a dolphin, so I guess ocean it is.

Maybe with karma pi for the kissing dolphins?

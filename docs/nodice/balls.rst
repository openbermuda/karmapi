 Round Objects
===============

There was an organisation.  It had reached peak bureaucracy, a well
oiled machine.

Memos flew and whirled and rested in trays and all was well.

But then came a note about kettles and leads and forms to be filled
and asking for comments.

ROUND OBJECTS

seemed vaguer but yet conveyed the thought.

And time passed as the memo went down the streames and up the pipes of
the well oiled machine.

"Who is Mr Round, and why does he object?"

Balls
=====

Round things,   They are everywhere.  Spirals too.

Sometimes you are outside looking in watching a ball perhaps.

Sometimes you are inside looking out, guessing what may be beyond.


If you are outside looking in, then you do not see what is going on
inside the ball, you just see what emerges from its surface and how it
interacts with its surroundings.

If you are inside looking out then forces outside the sphere may not
be visible to you.

If a sphere is in harmony with its surroundings, free falling through
space then inside the sphere those surroundings have no effect.

Except that they do.

The ball is in harmony with the surrounding fabric of space time.

But that very fabric is a backround field of low amplitude vibrations.

The amplitude of these vibrations being at the quantum level, random
perturbations that we can only observe indirectly.

Matter will try to vibrate in harmony with other matter vibrating
with same frequency.

It takes energy for it not to do so.

 Round Objects
===============

There was an organisation.  It had reached peak bureaucracy, a well
oiled machine.

Memos flew and whirled and rested in trays and all was well.

But then came a note about kettles and leads and forms to be filled
and asking for comments.

ROUND OBJECTS

seemed vaguer but yet conveyed the thought.

And time passed as the memo went down the streames and up the pipes of
the well oiled machine.

"Who is Mr Round, and why does he object?"

Balls
=====

Round things,   They are everywhere.  Spirals too.

Sometimes you are outside looking in watching a ball perhaps.

Sometimes you are inside looking out, guessing what may be beyond.

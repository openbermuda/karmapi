Going for a song.

Karma for free.

Mana too.

Puzzles galore.

And a vision.

When all is gone

We have unity

Help the down stream

And plot with a rainbow

Pandas for data

And Jupyter connects us all.

With git and bash and python 3 6

It's all you need in the karma pi class.

Requirements are there, but they are advisory

I should do a release, so go read my README at rest.

Start at the top, git log README.rst

git log too, see what's there.

docs are nodice

but that is a rongo rongo tale.

No start and no end

But start anywhere

Follow the commit if lost in a forest.

Round and round, branch and fork.

I should do release, let's give it a name.

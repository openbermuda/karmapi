 Fred Hoyle: The Nature of the Universe
========================================

I just changed coordinates.

New location good, but temperature has been multiplied by minus one.

Green turned to white, with crystal stalagtites.

Found a box of books out of storage.

And amongst them, Fred Hoyle.

Mum mentioned him.  He grew up in Bingley, Yorkshire.

Guess maybe Myrtle Park school?

The book follows a series of lectures Hoyle gave at Cambridge,
around 1950.

The first edition was published in 1960 with a July 1959 preface that
states that it has been revised where recent astronomical work makes
it necessary to do so.  The chapter dealing with the origin of the
planets has been completely re-written.

The book was 3 shillings and sixpence.

But is marked 20 pence, so from a second hand book store some time
since 1970.

125 pages and 4 plates of magic.

My guess is dad bought it some time since decimalisation.

And then I found it one visit home and started reading it (2003 --
there was a receipt from that date in the book).

I had put Colin Rourke's, A new paradigm on the Universe on my
Christmas book list.  Actually, I inserted it into my partner's book
list in the hope someone might accidentally get it her.

But no luck.  So a copy may now be in the post.

The timing of the find of Fred Hoyle's book could not have been
better.

It has been fascinating to wind back a lifetime, to a
book published before I was born.

It is a stunning account of how the nature of the universe.

There are just 5 chapters, around 20 pages each.

Earth and nearby space
======================

The Sun and the stars
=====================

How are star works.

and its relation to the hydrogen bomb.


Origin of the stars
===================

Origin of the earth and the planets
===================================

Speed of rotation of the sun.

Key role of magnetism.

Conservation of angular momentum.

Magnetic clock springs.

Expanding Universe?
===================

Expanding and constantly generating new atoms.

It should note that whilst Hoyle talked of an expanding universe,
nothing in his arguments involved a big bang.

Rather, he sets the scene with clouds of hydrogen soup.

A Personal view of all the things they say
==========================================

The book ends with Fred giving his personal view at the time.

On a back page, someone has written "of all the things they say".

So here is a personal view of all the things I may have heard.

It is now 2018, 68 years since the first edition.

We have computers the power of a Cray XMP in our pockets.

And images of the stars from 13 billion light years away.

And LIGO detectors that show gravitational waves exist.

Black holes colide and out go the waves.

Expansion and big bangs

red shift.

more than one way to shift red.

At the time of the book, it was difficult to see beyond our own spiral
galaxy.   Powerful telescopes were a very new thing.

Within that galaxy the red shift of light appears to be a good indicator of
distance.

This also appears to give a *coherent* view of the universe out to the
13B light year range currently observable.

As Colin Rourke observes [1] a rapidly spinning black hole at the
centre of a galaxy can result in a red shift of light from the spiral
galaxy of stars surrounding that black hole.

I believe that this can be shown to be the case.



Self and circular reference
---------------------------

Cosmology, theoretical physics, mathematics and computer codes can all
very quickly become "self-referencial".

Following a train of thought and going round in circles.

Cosmology is a bit like mathematics.  You have to make some
assumptions and see where it leads.

If the assumptions make good predictions, then it may be a good
theory.

But don't forget the assumptions, you may have new observations to
refine those assumptions.

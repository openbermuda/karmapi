 Fred Hoyle: The Nature of the Universe
========================================

I just changed coordinates.

New location good, but temperature has been multiplied by minus one.

Green turned to white, with crystal stalagtites.

Found a box of books out of storage.

And amongst them, Fred Hoyle.

Mum mentioned him.  He grew up in Bingley, Yorkshire.

Guess maybe Myrtle Park school?

The book follows a series of lectures Hoyle gave at Cambridge,
around 1950.

The first edition was published in 1960 with a July 1959 preface that
states that it has been revised where recent astronomical work makes
it necessary to do so.  The chapter dealing with the origin of the
planets has been completely re-written.

The book was 3 shillings and sixpence.

But is marked 20 pence, so from a second hand book store some time
since 1970.

125 pages and 4 plates of magic.

My guess is dad bought it some time since decimalisation.

And then I found it one visit home and started reading it (2003 --
there was a receipt from that date in the book).

I had put Colin Rourke's, A new paradigm on the Universe on my
Christmas book list.  Actually, I inserted it into my partner's book
list in the hope someone might accidentally get it her.

So meanwhile, it has been fascinating to wind back a lifetime, to a
book published before I was born.

It is a stunning account of how the nature of the universe.

Earth and nearby space
======================

The Sun and the stars
=====================

and the hydrogen bomb.

Origin of the stars
===================

Origin of the earth and the planets
===================================

Speed of rotation of the sun.

Key role of magnetism.

Expanding Universe?
===================

Expanding and constantly generating new atoms.

It should note that whilst Hoyle talked of an expanding universe,
nothing in his arguments involved a big bang.

Rather, he sets the scene with clouds of hydrogen soup.

A Personal view of all the things they say
==========================================

Hyrdrogen soup.

Magnetic springs.

Balls

Rotation

Spiral galaxies

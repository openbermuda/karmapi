 From Rano Raraku to Orongo
============================

There and back again, to see how far it is.

A 500 million year musical adventure.

Planetary harmony
=================

Stable systems follow harmonic rules.

cf periods of neighbouring planetary conjugations.

Solar wind
==========

This is supersonic at times, but broadly the right speed, 300km/s or
so. Or not, think I am out by three orders of magnitude!

Should come as a caveat in what follows, just trying to get some ideas
written down.

This is fascinating:

Galactic wind?
==============

Surely galaxies must have similar features?

Magnetic springs
================

gyroscopes.  System stabilizers.

Field carried by solar wind.


Micro-waves and water
=====================

CMB that we see has passed the Hubble distance and lots of intervening
matter.

So there is a question of what exactly are we looking at?

Filtered(Background)

But doesn't the filter mirror what is beyond?

And broadly shaped by it?

How far can we really see?

I keep thinking of consequences of Mach's principle when you divide
things into three bodies:::

  Thing of omega as angular momentum or intertial field of body
  
   \omega_U = \omega_G + \omega_B

Where:::
  
  $U$ represents universe's inertial effect on the galaxy.
  $G$ represents the galaxies inertial effect on the universe.
  $B$ represents central black hole's inertial effect on the Universe.

  In fact, U, G, B could be any three bodies, but in this case I am
  distinguishing the matter in the central black hole from the rest of
  the galaxy and noting this is 90% of the total mass in the galaxy.

The first paragraph in Colin Rourke's, "A new paradigm for the
universe"::
  
   This book provides a completely new approach to understanding the
   universe.  The main idea is that the principal objects in the
   universe form a spectrum unified by the presence of a massive or
   hypermassive black hole.  These objects are variously called
   quasars, active galaxies and spiral galaxies.  The key to
   understanding their dynamics is angular momentum and the key tool,
   and main innovative idea of this work, is a proper formulation of
   ``Mach's principle'' using Sciama's ideas.


   

With the above in mind, I think it is reasonable to just restrict
ourselves to the central black holes.

Noting, that each central mass will reflect it's surrounding galaxy.

Noting that harmony appears everywhere in stable systems.

2.7K background radiation.  Energy from oscillations of local
gravitational field.

Incoming: GRB

Leaving: receding galaxies, below the noise

Gamma ray bursts.
 
Galaxies with the same period, support each other, dancing together.

Ripple from a galaxy that is aligned would be tiny relative to the
light ray that it carries.   Tiny corresponds to lower frequency,
perhaps we will start to see these as the LIGO detectors get more
sensitive and more plentiful.

The smaller quasars, responsible for weaker GRB, are more likely to
impact the inertial field, relative to it's galaxy's background.
Hence higher frequency gravitational wave.

Three components: angle of rotation of BH, three components.


Gravitational field for a newly arriving galaxy is in sync with
surroundings and will have been emitting energy (seen as CMB) for a
good while.  As far as the graitational wave that arrives, there is no
surprise.

Geodesic version:::


    Thing in terms of light following a geodesic in de Sitter Space.
    It will be subject to any harmonics in the inertial field.

    In short, galaxies release energy in terms of the modulations that
    the galaxy makes to the background inertial field.

    Idea is de Sitter space with a 500 million year wobble.

    Limitting factor is inertial effect a black hole can have on
    terminal speed of matter in its galaxy.

Note that the geodesics are the de Sitter field after it has been
modulated by the black holes, which are moving in a universal wave.

The period is limited by the speed of light across the visible
universe and in particular by the distance a body moves relative to
its inertial background in the time it takes to cross the Hubble
distance.


A black hole of a given mass is limited into the size of inertial
impact by the rate at which it can transfer angular momentum to the
surrounding universe.

This in turn is limited by the size of the black hole.

In the limit, appears to be around 300km/s.


At this point there are lots of levels of these systems where we reach
a point of equilibrium.   Many just adabpt to their environment.

Maybe all do?


Fundamental
===========

Think of black holes as balls tied together with magic strings,
spinning together.

The energy which drives this system is a wobble in the wave of time.

It would seem to have been running a while.

Time for harmonies to arise on a huge scale.

There appear to be a lot of levels through the universe where stable
systems can emerge.

Is 2.7K enough to heat a visible universe?  It would seem so.

Now we see a 500 million year wobble in the CMB.

This is the sum of new arrivals over all departures in the life of a
universe.

There are lots of levels througout our universe where stable systems
can emerge.  By stable, structures that can potentially sustain
themselves for billions of years.

As well of systems that exist for a fraction of a second, in a
localised area.

System: anything that affects the inertial field.
   

Conservation of momentum
========================

Even with the tangential inertial drag, the momentum of the whole
system is maintained as 

Note round trip time between bodies: period for harmonics?

Earth/sun: 16 minutes.

Earth moon: 2.6 seconds.

Everything wobbles about it's period.


LIGO
====

My guess is galactic arrivals are lower frequency than current
technology detects.

Wil see what turns up this year as I think new science runs are due.


Climate and quake
=================

Earth's magnetic field has varied considerably over the estimaated 4
billion year age of earth.

Presumably, magnetic storms within the earth (and any planet with
magnetic field) will presumably be driven by common drivers:::

  period of local body's magnetic field

  period of local body's day/year

  body could be star, planet, moon, electron, proton...

As an example, the field around the earth will be dominated by the local
magnetic core, but then the sun, moon, and planets, particular note
jupiter.

A bodies affect on the rest of the universe's inertial field exactly
matches it's difference to that inertial field.


Numerology department
=====================

500 million light years ~= distance travelled relative to inertial
field in time for CMB to arrive.

2 degrees at the Hubble distance.

Harmonics too.  1/3 and 1/5.

Keep thinking of::

  \pi / 4 = 1 - 1/3 + 1/5 - 1/7 + 1/9 ...




  
1 degree: precession of earth in 72 years, relative to celestial
background.  26,000 years per cycle.

 From Rano Raraku to Orongo
============================

There and back again, to see how far it is.

A 500 million year musical adventure.

Planetary harmony
=================

Stable systems follow harmonic rules.

cf periods of neighbouring planetary conjugations.

Solar wind
==========

This is supersonic at times, but broadly the right speed, 300km/s or so.

This is fascinating:

Galactic wind?
==============

Surely galaxies must have similar features?

Magnetic springs
================

gyroscopes.  System stabilizers.

Field carried by solar wind.


Micro-waves and water
=====================

CMB that we see has passed the Hubble distance and lots of intervening
matter.

So there is a question of what exactly are we looking at?

Filtered(Background)

But doesn't the filter mirror what is beyond?

And broadly shaped by it?

How far can we really see?


Conservation of momentum
========================

Even with the tangential inertial drag, the momentum of the whole
system is maintained as 

Note round trip time between bodies: period for harmonics?

Earth/sun: 16 minutes.

Earth moon: 2.6 seconds.

Everything wobbles about it's period.


LIGO
====

My guess is galactic arrivals are lower frequency than current
technology detects.

Wil see what turns up this year as I think new science runs are due.


Climate and quake
=================



Numerology department
=====================

500 million light years ~= distance travelled relative to inertial
field in time for CMB to arrive.

2 degrees at the Hubble distance.

Harmonics too.  1/3 and 1/5.

Keep thinking of::

  \pi / 4 = 1 - 1/3 + 1/5 - 1/7 + 1/9 ...




  
1 degree: precession of earth in 72 years, relative to celestial
background.  26,000 years per cycle.

Harper Lee too.

Leamington Spa

And algol 66

A Poincare space.

And Rubik's cube with monster groups.

Cards to be punched

Back in an hour

but always build bridges

so others can do things

the way they learn to know.

the first computer.  it shows you wonders.

Click with a mouse

Or fingers on keyboard.

Pretty much all no touch screen.

And once you tame the beast its good enough.

I should know.  30 years and more and still emacs.

But I have tried it with IDLE the Eric of old or new.

And that works for me.

Thinking of DB in a deep lawyers basement.

Typing python and finding 2.2.   That will do nicely, thank you.

That's a db that's Beazely with cookbook curios.

Guido to guide and so many more.

more fun to code in the open

It helps focus the mind.

Karma dividing by Pi

Spreading it out.

Until it goes below the noise.

A quantum cat.

Of blue and red and white stripes.

And what of the Bee, the new Py Bee.

Get on your phone no need to beware the IDES of Py.

 Pi Is Transcendental
======================

Snowy the cat, brought us Pi-Ri,

Pi-Ri the pirate cat.

Over the sea to a land of ice.

Pi-ri the cat, divide by three,

Point 1, 4, 2

'Cos pi is transcendental.

For just one quarter of a pie,

Here's a simple recipe.

Start with 1, that's Napoleon's pi

Take off 1 part in three.

And now add back in just one in five.

'Cos pi is transendental

Take back out a one in seven

And now back in just one in nine

That's one in three of the one in three we took,

So let's start with one, and add another two.

Then split the three to two and one

Rinse repeat times five.

Now take the five and find just 3 to add back into the pie.

No all gather round, and make a circle,

It never ends, goes on and on,

'Cos pi is transendental.

====================
 Strange Attractors
====================

Nature love spirals and spheres.

When two waves pass, they may attract each other and circle each other
in a dance, suspended in space.

They aim to be in harmony with their peers.

But they are dragged along by what surrounds them.

Which in turn is trying to be in harmony with its surroundings.

To break the harmony, energy is needed.

Raising the amplitude until it emits its own flash of light.

Waves everywhere.

We can't see them, sometimes we get glimpses.

Patterns and waves in the water of time.

Driving our thoughts as we sense harmony.

====================
 Strange Attractors
====================

Nature love spirals and spheres.

When two waves pass, they may attract each other and circle each other
in a dance, suspended in space.

They aim to be in harmony with their peers.

But they are dragged along by what surrounds them.

Which in turn is trying to be in harmony with its surroundings.

To break the harmony, energy is needed.

Raising the amplitude until it emits its own flash of light.

Waves everywhere.

We can't see them, sometimes we get glimpses.

Patterns and waves in the water of time.

Driving our thoughts as we sense harmony.

Beginnings
==========

Folklore and unix, unicos and sunos.

Magic with math.

Puzzles to puzzle.

Bash and emacs

version control too.

strange beginnings sccs rcs cvs svn - hg darcs bazaar - git

All the same but strangely different.

Next there was linus with redhat and irix and always rms for gcc

Except on irix where egcs wrestled with the rhymes of stroustrop

Bot mostly the stl.

pick-up-a-pick-up-a-p
=====================

perl and tcl, a wish and a prayer.

a version six? and what about tix?

then there was python of monthy ball fame.

from guido with his magic time machine.

1.5 to 2.2 and later 2.6

The 2.7, 3.0, 2.7,3.1, 2.*, 3.4, 2.7, 3.5, 3.6

Always the GIL but now with async to await


Meanwhile in parallel universes
===============================

I worked on with emacs, bash and now python.

Always bridges to build to another strange land.

Access xl sql db

And the land of the graphic user test

And just when you pass that gut score, a new gut brings promise and
less.



XL cats Charlie Frances Ivan Jeanne
===================================

SnowyN
======

I am told he likes cats, as I do too.

They show me how and what and when to care.

So there have been a few snowies.

Snowy the first, a republican cat.

A cat from Clontarf, on the line to the city.

Out to Kildare with the lilly white air.

Scared of the dogs here, big as horses.

A stroke or two, now I am scared.

And Sooty the stealth cat, no flap training there.

Who knelt to Snowy, only here for the food.

Snowy2
------

Snowy2, a quantum cat.  White noise and calm.  A steady background
beat.

Takes his time all is good.

Snowy lived with a giant dog in devonshire, so moved to southampton,
yby the lighthouse.

Tinkerbell in his field, looking for the ghyll, waiting for the rain.

And the storms, Fay, Gonzalo, Joaquim, Alex, Karl and Nicole.

Both snowy's came with a name.

Ando sooty was always going to be sooty.

There must be snowie every where.

So Snowy4 counts for all n > 3.

Charged on his mid-summer birthday.  2013 june 21.

30 for him just one for me and m.


NSA document stash
==================

I knew some like snowden, a younger flash gordon.

Fixed the code when something ran slow.

Now snowy4, helping humans use software.

As they scoop up the waves.

The world changing fast.

Take a beat and look around.

Lots of good here to be found.


Remember, remember the 5th of november
======================================

Alan Rusbridger, a guardian leader.  Sat in the kitchen, reading the
letters.  Talking to Brenda, queen of the crossword.

Said I would like Cheltenham, fun to be had there.

Puzzles like puzzles you never to see.

People to help.  Ellis and Cocks.  Turing and Toulmin.

Now the numbers were small.  We shared with each other and select
others.

And always it was felt on the side of the good.

If you can't keep a secret we can't do our job.

So suddenly secrets are there in the paper.

20 years later and look how it has changed.

9/11 the rules forgotten.

Collecting it all, but missing the pearls.

Red white and blue
==================

It has been a strange journey with a rainbow of colours.

The beginnings they echo the python moves strong.

And easier and easier to do what we dreamed of.

But harder and harder to please.

For fear of computers that we can't control.

And only a form to update.

qotd::
  
   Well, I really want to encourage a kind of fantasy, a kind of
   magic. I love the term magic realism, whoever invented it â€“ I do
   actually like it because it says certain things. It's about
   expanding how you see the world. I think we live in an age where
   we're just hammered, hammered to think this is what the world
   is. Television's saying, everything's saying 'That's the world.'
   And it's not the world. The world is a million possible things

====================
 Strange Attractors
====================

Nature love spirals and spheres.

When two waves pass, they may attract each other and circle each other
in a dance, suspended in space.

They aim to be in harmony with their peers.

But they are dragged along by what surrounds them.

Which in turn is trying to be in harmony with its surroundings.

To break the harmony, energy is needed.

Raising the amplitude until it emits its own flash of light.

Waves everywhere.

We can't see them, sometimes we get glimpses.

Patterns and waves in the water of time.

Driving our thoughts as we sense harmony.

Beginnings
==========

Folklore and unix, unicos and sunos.

Magic with math.

Puzzles to puzzle.

Bash and emacs

version control too.

strange beginnings sccs rcs cvs svn - hg darcs bazaar - git

All the same but strangely different.

Next there was linus with redhat and irix and always rms for gcc

Except on irix where egcs wrestled with the rhymes of stroustrop

Bot mostly the stl.

pick-up-a-pick-up-a-p
=====================

perl and tcl, a wish and a prayer.

a version six? and what about tix?

then there was python of monthy ball fame.

from guido with his magic time machine.

1.5 to 2.2 and later 2.6

The 2.7, 3.0, 2.7,3.1, 2.*, 3.4, 2.7, 3.5, 3.6

Always the GIL but now with async to await


Meanwhile in parallel universes
===============================

I worked on with emacs, bash and now python.

Always bridges to build to another strange land.

Access xl sql db

And the land of the graphic user test

And just when you pass that gut score, a new gut brings promise and
less.



XL cats Charlie Frances Ivan Jeanne
===================================

Snowy2
======

I am told he likes cats, as I do too.

They show me how and what and when to care.


NSA document stash
==================

I knew some like snowden, a younger flash gordon.

Fixed the code when something ran slow.

Now snowy2, helping humans use software.

As they scoop up the waves.

The world was changing fast.

Take a beat and look around.

Lots of good here to be found.

Hi Colin,

A copy of "A Brief History of Time" crossed my path.

I'd read it before, but it is a whole different story in the light of
your theories.

In fact, much of it is very helpful in thinking about the black hole
inertial drag issue.

Surface area of combined black holes is >= sum of the areas of the
pieces, entropy and more.

Oh and I wasn't aware that the Pope said yes to the Big Bang Theory in
the 1950's.

This problem is way bigger than I realised.

I have been flipping between the two books and now feel I have a
pretty good understanding of it all.

de Sitter space -- so a sphere embedded in Minkowski space?

This reminds me of a piece I wrote back in September when I started
thinking about the black holes (or neutron stars!) colliding.

I think I should take another pass through these writings.  With luck
I can turn it into a nice introduction to your book.

Like the *Big Red Algebra book* back in the day on how to care for a
pet algebra.

Here's a link to the piece back in September, `balls.rst`.

I am starting to think about simulations of de Sitter space. 

Thank you for the book.  I think the arguments are very, very strong
and the case is compelling.

Changing the potential age of the universe by many orders of magnitude
has profound implications.

I am also trying to weave into my ideas some thoughts on information,
observations data and knowledge.

And in particular, inertia and memory in societies.   

All the best.

Johnny

    This book provides a completely new approach to understanding the
    universe. The main idea is that the principal objects in the
    universe form a spectrum unified by the presence of a massive or
    hypermassive black hole. These objects are variously called
    quasars, active galaxies and spiral galaxies. The key to
    understanding their dynamics is angular momentum and the key tool,
    and main innovative idea of this work, is a proper formulation of
    “Mach’s principle” using Sciama’s ideas.

The first paragraph in Colin Rourke's, "A new paradigm for the
universe".

Feedback from chief editor was that more explanation was needed.

First of all, I mentioned a lot of people, particularly in the fields
of mathematics and theoretical physics.

I think all of them have been in some way trying to describe wider
pictures.

And it feels like there is nothing that I am thinking that has not
been thought before.

I still have not made it back to a second read of your book, but have
been thinking a lot about Sciama spaces, Minkowski too with some
Poincare too.

Now these are all things others understand better than me.

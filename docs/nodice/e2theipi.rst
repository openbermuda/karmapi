An nth root of e to the i pi.

Now here is a thing.

Let's say pi=3 and so does e.

Now here is a thing.

e *pi ~ 3 * 3 = 9

So add a bit and call it 10 or pie

e ^ pi ^ e ~ pi ^ e ^ pi or 3 ^ 3 = 27

Add a bit and call it 30.

Now 10 ^ 30 lets square it.

That's 10 ^ 60

Or the size of the universe in planks.

And the age of the universe in planks too.

And the mass or the energy of the universe in planks as well.

So maybe the plank isn't constant?

It shrinks in time as the universe grows.

If you live 1 degree by pi to the n, then how could you know?

=========================================
 Just in from Burk who holds the other A
=========================================

I'll begin at the end with the response::

    awesome.

    from now on in no dice, if you see ray the burk hold a

    or something like that... it's you, or someone that's very like you

    in some dimension..

    this is awesome.. thanks with much beer to come..

    Nov 2nd?  now there's an idea 55 - 33,  I'll bring some cards.

    We can fix it if its not fixed by then.


    Johnny wo the gilly, pi times slower may be good for a plank.


Now from the bard, copy paste?::

  
    At the other end of the spectrum from this morning's missive

    How many subscribe to scholarly things like 'Communications of the
    ACM'?  or the 'IEEE Spectrum'?  I guess the chemist in the group will
    need to fill in the blank with her chosen geek publication.

    I then I took it one step further and sat at a table by myself down
    at the club, and read it cover to cover.  With a beer or two.

    And something that hasn't happened in a long time, or well, ever, I got
    called out as a sterotype:  looking like a geek from San Francisco.  Well,
    that was what the woman, who also had no conversational partner, used to
    strike up a conversation.

    Who would have thought, that in the CACM, you see such interesting things
    like:


    "Divination is the practice of occultic ritual as an aid in decision
    making", on page 7 no less.  Which goes on to say that "... divination truly
    allows us to consult the divine, we can view it simply as a form of
    randomization, which is recognized as a powerful construct in game theory,
    and algorithm design."  ... "randomization is a powerful way to deal with
    incomplete information"  ... "they are simply randomizing  in the face of
    uncertainty about rain, pests, and more, but this randomization comes with a
    belief in the divine source of the decision".... "when the accept/reject
    decision pivots on issues such as significance and interestingness, which
    can be quite subjective".

    Another article:  "Assuring Software Quality by Preventing Neglect"....
    which is a 'grayhat' problem when compared to blackhats (hackers who deploy
    software as a weapon with malicious intent) and whitehats (setting
    safeguards against defective products".  With a few interesting conversation
    starters being, I think: ".... during maintenance cycles, they do not
    correct the old source code comments, seeing such as edits as risky and
    presumptuous".  ... "it is a failure of degree, a failure to pay enough
    attention and take enough trouble"   ... which leads to a theory of "ethics
    of care which displaces the classical agent centered morality of duty and
    justice, endoring patient-centered morality as manifest real-tim in
    relationships".

    And, well, l something which probably everyone knows, but has been evolving
    through a series of articles in the magazine, is that machine learning
    algorithms require training time via "generative adversarial networks",
    which means you need to mix in some sneaky garbage to improve the odds of
    appropriate machine learning.

    And another, in which I can personally associate: "Multitasking Without
    Thrashing".  "Human context switching is more complicated than computer
    context switching.  Whereas the computer context switch replaces a fixed
    number of bytesi n a few CPU registers, the human has to recall what was "on
    the mind" at the time of the switch, and, if the human was interrupted with
    no opportunity to choose a "clean break", the human has to reconstruct lost
    short term memory" ... "if you have several important tasks, your brain can
    get stuck in a decision process that can take quite a long time to decide --
    a situation known as the choice uncertainty problem".  ... "thrashing
    happens to human multitaskers when they have too many incomplete tasks.
    They fall into mood of 'overwhelm' in which they experience considerable
    stress" ..... "context switching is _not_ the cause of thrashing.  ... the
    cause of thrashing is the failure to give every active task enough space for
    its working set"... "when a task's working set is in your workspace,
    preotect it from being unloaded as long as the task is active .. analog:
    protect working sets of active tasks and do not steal from other tasks". ...
    "to exit the thrashing state, you need to reduce demand or increase your
    capacity".


    Ok one more: "what we have instead is a society moving towards prosthetic
    brains that can be monitored at all times by the state, without the
    inconvenience of having to have everyone check in each day at the police
    station".    When you read this, were you thinking "this isn't me!"?   Well,
    this is visible by what we write, where we write, what we read, where we
    read, who we interact with, what we interact with, ....

 The Guitar Man
================

I look in the mirror as I shave, sometimes I see dad's face.

There is a lot of mum and dad in me.

Mum was magic.

I must have been 5 or so, I asked for something.

She said say the magic word.

Abracadabra!

It worked.

Dad would buy books for presents.  Books he wanted to read too.

And he often read them first.

There were other books.  The Lord of the Rings.

Not one of dad's, but she knew I would like.

And I did.  It took forever.  Tom Bombadil, what was that about?

I skipped past the songs, I should go there again.

Puzzles too, lots of puzzles.

And maps from dad.  Always maps.

And some books that he wrote, research, control and behaviour.

And later from mum, perfume.

Now I find the harmony repeats.

As I find things of to delight to me and you.

I bought a guitar as a gift.  And it gifted to me.

I did not know music, I liked what I heard, but never could quite
fathom it.

What I learned on the way is strange harmony and a beat that goes on
forever.

A little random perturbation in the fabric of time.

Paper
=====

When I was sick, she showed me to fold paper, all the way from Japan
origami.

Frogs, always frogs, but sometimes a bird.

Cross Words
===========

Never and always crosswords.

At the table with a clue, some letters and a guess.

To a question an answer, but often a question.

Radio silence
=============

Talk on the radio, music too, bbc.

And crystal set with long wire aerial.

Electronics and adding machines.

Wheels
======

Wheels of granite, wheels of wood, powered by water forging the steel.

Red and white and white and blue.

And legends of a purple hugh.

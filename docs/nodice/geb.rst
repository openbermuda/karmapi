===================
 Godel Escher Back
===================

The book from the 80's.

Saturday book shop.

I read it once for the ants, the hare and the tortoise.

I read for godel and escher too.

I didn't do music, but racacar was fun.

Palindrome patterns in time.

I'll read it again, this time for bach.

And maybe I will lend it like K lahrs Lohn

To infinity slalom and magic beyond.

======================
 Too much antigravity
======================

So back at the game, the cat lottery, all is a buzz with cats every
where.

Numbers to crunch, the market won't wait.

Well maybe a bit lets all watch the news.

Air says a flood, but wind was bad too.

And still it is raining, so lets wait and see.

No matter, there is data and numbers to crunch.

Piri the Pyrate
===============

So things were good for a while.

Piri new python and python was magic.

A time machine that could tell you the future.

As you catch its tail it pulls you along.

As you ride its wave, wherever it will go.

The players were nervous, back at the cattery.

These cats were unpredictable things.

We thought we knew what to expect from the model.

But this is quite different a 1 in 100.

No matter Piri can tweak the model, all will be good.

Important antigravity
=====================

Piri had worked magic with python for many a year.

That was always the easy bit.
 
There was always something fun to do, if only they would lend the
time.

But there were memos and meetings and user stories.

Now there were quite some requests.   This button in blue.  This one
on the right.

The table below with commas in threes.

Piri mostly ignored the orders and did what was best, for some kind of
best.

Snowy the filter would just bounce things back, and distract all
requests with a pantomime act.

But one day a memo returned, with the following inscription in bold:

*Round Objects*

Now Snowy was doing his lie on the back and let them tickle his tummy
act and so missed the memo's arrival.

Piri had been watching Dave quite literally removing the GIL, with
python controlling it all.

Why would you want all objects to be round?

Piri jumped in the air and dabbed Snowy as he flew by.

I have had it with here, time to import some antigravity.

The Ballmer Peak
================

Has anyone seen Snowy and PiRi?

Awkward silence.

At times like this, eyes move to Sooty, who will know what to do.

Sooty looks pale, a night chasing down?

So they went to the Rovers Return, at the end of the street.

When I left them they were testing whiskies, with beer to rinse in
between.

Piri was talking of bagging Monroes in some place called Scotland.

And typing away on a laptop::

   # divide by zero magic

   import antigravity
   import gilliam
   
   antigravity.geohash(gilliam.placetime)
   

And then they were gone.  The laptop too. 

Sooty looked paler.  He knew it sounded sketchy.

Another day, he's have flipped off the sofa and said he left when the
whiskey came out.

Dividing by zero
================

Piri and Snowy were not seen again.

One quarter went by, the numbers were fine.

Another went by still all was good.

And nobody knew what Piri had done.

Until it just stopped, who could take a look?

Well Sooty said show me the stack.

He scrolled to the end, and found a few lines::

   # divide by zero magic

   import antigravity
   import gilliam
   
   error = loss / skill
  
Oh dear, its Gilliam again.

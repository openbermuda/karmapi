 Red and white or red and blue
===============================

Red and white, or red and blue, what's with blue and white?

93 old td.

Pesky solid, from 3m by pi

See man hand

Its in the net

Or on the line

No russians here

It doesn't count.

96 web burly

Sausage man

With crazy mullet

40 yards, wait what no

45 what a corker...

Bassett's hounds are on the hunt

Extra time

Never a glimmer

Home up the m1

Grand national fever

Falls at the start line

Winner not winner and runs again

2015 bailey's and cream

cricket fever

the cat with the hat

a pi and a stream of data

blue boys arrive

white in the middle

red blue all around

time for a swizzle

but what of the score

Quarter to seven

20 runs

3 wickets, or there abouts.

Red and white, from bailey's bay

7 and twenty and its now a draw.

Scores all level a wicket or two.

But why 7 20? Rule book time.

Like Carlos Tivos and the west bacon fest?

Happier times in 75

With brooking and tc, woodward too.

But now its got wilder in 2016

Jack and his hat.

The cat with a red and white hat.

To the right, to the left.

He'll head it all day.

To cup match in somers, where the sun sets.

2014 I guess.   A red and blue draw.

Its hot, lets keep the cup here.

2017 near hallows eve.

Up the M1

Like the hero TC

For 200K in 76

So take 5-10 to the road of the elland

And hope for a day like the one at the sty.

A game of red and blue passion.

With the magic all red

With faint blue ripples.

4 2 that will do.

So over to to Euro last 8

For a place in moscow

Without the US

North iron or Swiss

Croatio or Greece

Denmark or Green

Swede or Azure

Let's watch the bottles and see what they say.

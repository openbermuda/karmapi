The nature of the inertial drag field
=====================================

I spent much of the summer looking at waves in a pool and thinking
about quantum phenomena.

I also thought about the fields inside colliding black holes and how
the natural numbers might emerge, if you will excuse the pun,
naturally.

But how it is more complicated than that because of the echoes.   And
how at the boundary the echo is modulated by the surrounding universe.


[Aside:  There are a number of incoherent writings here from that period.  One
task ahead is to go through these and perhaps, assuming I can
understand my own writing, translate them into something other people
can understand too.

Rotation is fundamental to this and the ideas are easiest explained
when two black holes of roughly equal mass collide.

In layman's terms, I believe what goes in, must come out.

Now lets scale things down a bit.

Consider a large rotating sphere of ice and consider how this modulates
the background gravitational field.

Now assume the sphere has a radius r, big enough that in the time it
takes light to travel distance r, it has rotated an angle \omega and
that \omega * r is large compared to the distance between adjacent H2O
molecules in the ice.

Inertia, the two versions of G, conservation of momentum.

Conservation of energy too.

And then there are thoughts about wave particle duality.

Hoyle's expanding universe with continuous creation.

Big bangs are a thing.  Almost surely was one in our past.

Almost surely, a very, very long time ago.

But regardless of our origin, LIGO experiments show that black holes
are colliding all the time.

So the good news is that all the physics research around big bang
theory still has great relevance in your paradigm for the universe.

But I keep coming back to what goes in must come out.

Bringing this back to earth and the solar system.

I believe we can diagnose our planet (and solar system too) and
produce models for the magnetic storms going on inside our planet.

As well as the ocean currents and atmosphere: in short climate models
that tease out the relationships with the key drivers of the dynamics.

Features such as El Nino could then be forecast with skill much
further into the future.

Intriguingly, there is a lot of overlap in the software tools for both
problems.

The problem with software is that it is a general thing.  So you can
always further abstract until there is almost nothing left.  But this
is also its power because you can build 20-30 general tools that play
together nicely and now you have almost infinite variety.

And then you end up stuck trying to decide where to go next.

I may have mentioned before I recall Christopher Zeeman saying that
"all great mathematicians are inherently lazy".

The same is true in software.

But in both cases, what Chris forgot to say was that they also will
spend a disproportionate amount of time avoiding tedious, error prone,
repetition.

Regardless, I do wish to thank Christopher for this, and many other
wonderful pieces of advice and wisdom.

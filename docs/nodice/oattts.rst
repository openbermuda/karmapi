 Of All The Things They Say
============================

A personal view.

Fred Hoyle, Colin Rourke, Douglas Adams and an army of others with guides to the universe.

I am currently engrossed by Colin Rourke's, "A new paradigm for the
universe" (ANPOTA).

Zeeman, causality implies the Lorenz group.   I wish I had known about
this the day he drove me in from Leamington Spa.

It has been a strange journey so far, full of coincidence or not.  Or
maybe the journey is taking a path of high coincidence by choice?

The mathematics in the book I have found challenging at times.  It has
been a while since I read mathematics closely, wanting to understand
it all.

I have learnt some new names:  Sciama, de Sitter, Arp and some old
ones seen in new light: Mach, Einstein, Hoyle, Poincare.

I am on my third or fourth pass through the book.  Seven chapters and
seven appendices.

For me a reasonable order to read has been:

Introduction
============

 

Chapter 2 Sciama's Principle



Chapter 6 Observations

Chapter 7 Cosmology.


Chapters 3-5 are more math heavy, don't get bogged down there and miss
out on the joys of the final two chapters.
   
The appendices are full of helpful and fascinating information.

Appendices C, D and F are more observational

Appendices A, B, E and G  are more theoretical.


Of all the things they say
==========================

What follows are personal thoughts on the universe, un-encumbered by
any sort of fact checking, just seeing where they lead.

An approximation to the universe as described in ANPOTA is just to
ignore matter that is outside of the black holes at the centre of each
universe.

Now this approximation is a bit too strict to be useful.  Much of the
matter that is not in the form of black holes is nonetheless close to
a black hole cf matter in visible spiral galaxies.

Now this matter acts as a gravitational lens to the field emanating
from its black hole centre.

So, granted that may be an issue, but lets just see how things might
behave and then come back to the issue of surrounding matter.

But first, what happens when a giant cloud of hydrogen is sent
spinning gently through a universe?

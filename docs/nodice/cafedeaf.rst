=========
 Covfefe
=========

Saturday morning 2004.

Snowy and Sooty in the kitchen.

Kettle boils, pour the covfefe.

Into the bodum.

Add milk to the mugs and onto the tray.

No clothes to the bedroom

A start to the day

Not a good idea

Into the shower

That one is hot

Try the other

My that looks hot

Where is the doctor?

Nace the say, lets start a race.

Track pants and t-shirt

Across the bog

Driven by ER at just the right pace.

Hitting the bumbs but riding the wave

Into nace and check in time.

Name rank and number

And on to the gurney.

Covered in snow and more to swallow.

Now not so bad, but off to st james.

Man U on the radio, high as can be.

No news of the blades, how can it get?

Into a bed and laid there to rest.

Doctor will come on monday best.

Monday and heads they do shake.

Tuesday a cut we will make.

Woken with staples.

And a patch on the leg.

Trying to gage the size of the problem.

10 days and I am home.

pygtk to the rescue

Docs on a mem stick, 64 * n b.

Cafe deaf is the ailment.

A magic hex incantation.

However you mess

It stays there to wake you.

What's the question?  I guess I am not so sure myself.

Should sign up for a doctorate, but not the donkey work.

Unis these days, raising cash or making waves?

So I might just hang out in the Car el ton bar.

Talk about ideas, how the universe works.

That is that this is about

Maybe a book, but a a book that will be code.

A rongo-rongo script.

Undeciphered, though it is just plain text.

I think I know what it might be.

And how the Moai moved from the quarry to the shore.

Why they always face inland, except for a ki vi.

Giant magnets waddling around.

Working on a simulation

that may prove I am right.

There is a link with ptah from Egypt

And the theories of Max Planck

In fact its all related

Why I think I might be right.

I am sure it is what is already known

At least at time before

But many are down in the weed.

Not seeing what's above

But we all see more

Knowing the waves of G exist

E and M too, a unified model

You can explain it all, with speed of light waves.

Relativity too, special and general.

And Planck with Poincare

Godel Escher and Bach

Filled in the details for all.

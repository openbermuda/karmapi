========================
 Life in the multiverse
========================

by Zach Gill

I bought this CD along with a couple of others early in the year.


I'd never heard of Zach Gill, but I was busy contemplating the
universe with patience and guidance from Colin Rourke as I was
starting to explore his view on the universe.

So, I couldn't resist this.

But then months passed before the CD and a CD player came to be in the
same point in the universe.

The first word on the first track is *Johnny*::


  Johnny had a new plan
  time to be his own man
  knew that things would work out ok
  mostly optimistic, not hung on apologistic,
  he does the work before he gets paid
  
  he gets up
  he gets down
  
  hoping that the word gets around
  
  it's a struggle, that's ok
  learn a little more each day
  
  and if the rain don't come tomorrow it will come some day

  ... it will come some day

The track is called *Window Dressing*.

I'm not great at picking out lyrics, so it took me a while to pick up
the words, not least it seemed to be following my life... or rather
there's enough here to weave a lot of coincidence into a story.


And the second track is solstice::

  It was the solstice, it was a nice day

  Felt like the sun's rays, were shining from above

  It was the solstice, 2016

  Felt like I was sixteen and in love
  

  She was my wifey, moving like shakira
  
  I took her to bermuda

  We started to dance

  It was the solstice, 2016

  Still in the sweet dream of romance

  your hearts going to do just exactly what it's going to do

  so come on synchronicity  ...

  your hearts going to do just exactly what it's going to do


  ...

  
Again it feels personal, there's coincidence a plenty here a mixing of
universal stories.

And there is more of course.

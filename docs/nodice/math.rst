==================
 The Maths Debate
==================

There's foot ball at college.

Teams with fine names

There's cecil of the park

And len with the 8's and unders.

I never did play for the maths debators.

A team with no name?

With sterlo and bob

And jim in the room

with a rose on his back

that he sowed himself

with a lizzy thread of black

More he said

From the abbey in the glen

Foundation of math

With zebedee

H'ed been on the tele

With catastrophe

But now he was here

With lapin a gile

And offered us 50 per cent

We could have walked out right

There changed the denominator

And got 100 per cent

But we stayed for the deck chairs

Cos zebedee was a dog

A stairway to heaven

In the wood of L3

Mars outside

Cov for Fay too.

Oh what a story

In the holly bush spa

Den with a goddess

And world cup poker

Sterlo, the monkey hanger

And Bob from north of the river

I never did play for the maths debators

What was the team with no name?

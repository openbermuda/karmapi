 Dear Colin
============

::
   
   And also about your ideas, which I haven't understood at all so far.

So where to begin?


Energy and matter
=================

::

   e = m * c * c

c is the beat of time, let's set it to one.


Planck's constant
=================

::

   e = h * f

   momentum too, with conservation.


Gravity
=======

::

   f = G * a * b / (r * r)

G turns up in two ways:  gravitational force and inertial resistance


2015:  gravitational waves are a thing.

Time
====

Follow a wave, one full wavelength is a beat of time.

And the length a unit of distance.

A moving point.

Light
=====

A single wave, pi out of phase with the gravity field.

Follows a geodesic in the background field.

Quantum
=======

Don't focus on the photon, its the whole field in play.

But maybe the background fields super smooth?

Polaroid Lenses
===============

Bell's inequaity

Harmonic series
===============

Cosmic microwave background


Energy to matter
================

hydrogen

electron

proton

Rotation
========

Recipe
======

Start with nothing, an empty space.

Three dimensions passing through time.

At the origin, a small sphere.

Not so much a sphere, a dense core with a moon orbitting around.

So the moon sends a wave of energy, which modulates the signal from
the nucleus below, as it too spins.

Now imagine the surface of the sphere 2 * r from the origin.

At time t, what of the sphere at t * r?

=====================
 From Downy to Queen
=====================

We lost Downy

Just a while ago

201x at the nac no nra

Asked me to sing

But i didn't know the words

It didn't matter, they came to me

Moment of magic with er of the eye

Now downys gone, but it carries on

Day 1 of the artist aardvaark

A hip replacement of sorts.

Yellow and red, on the outside

Between six and seven

For the hip

Re place

mental

centre

cape robin

connie 53 or er 33

6.5 from cape breton

denim

and a red and white rose

with green there too

from the abbey in the glen

with malcolm nash

and sober as gary

not wilson, of 17 and 23 or 66 and 67?

In the ford with the brad?

With zip 2.3

it had to be signed

the prisoner in the center

to the east of the castle

with the pool and the light in the sun

where the answer is blowin in the wind

again, and again and again.. but never quite right..

or too wrong and too loud when more wrong and less loud might be good.

The answer came but what did it mean?

Off with a question, had to trade the good bit for

a receipt to be signed for for the one

in the chains at the castle

yes that's it

the queen from scot land

it the castle in sheffield

with the market that's now at the foot

of the moor,

which now's a good walk

from the moors over the

tunnel that goes

with a grin and a ford

to the dale of e

and the start of the py by e to the 9

check the log of the captain of the bog.

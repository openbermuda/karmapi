A REPL for the universal interpreter.

Without python and its community of magic little of what follows.

It is a personal interpretation of how our universe may work.

If you like, an interpreter, for the universe.

Now as we shall see, this interpretation is self referential, or at
least the universe it describes is.

There are beginnings and ends, but each beginning is also an end.

So where to start?

February 2015
=============

PyCaribbean in Santo Domingo.  The first ever python in the Caribbean.

During a keynote we learned it was python's 25th birthday.

We also learned that python was used at every step of the data
analysis of the signals from the LIGO experiment.

An experiment which had just detected two black holes, each more than
30 times the mass of our sun, which had collided with each other.

The collision was 1000 light years away and it created a ripple in
space time that LIGO detected.

This confirmed that gravitational waves really do exist, as Einstein
had proposed almost exactly 100 years ago.

So, let us start with the guess that all matter sends out a
gravitational wave as it moves.


Relativity
==========

Albert Enstein, everything is relative.

It depends on your point of view.

Every viewpoint is different.

As the viewer moves, so the view changes.

Waves will be waves.



Michelson-Morley
----------------

Michelson and Morley took a beam of light and split it into two
beams that they arranged to be travelling at right angles to each
other.

The beams were aimed at mirrors and then they attempted to see which
beam came back first.

The idea was that if everything is moving relative to some fixed
background *ether* we ought to be able to see how we are moving
relative to that *ether* by measuring which beam comes back first.

However, they found that no matter how they orientated their
experiment the two beams always returned at exactly the same time.

This suggested that everything revolved around the point in space
where they were doing the experiment, making the earth a very special
place in the universe.

Einstein and other scientists felt this was unlikely.

Einstein suggested that perhaps time runs slower for a moving frame of
reference, just enough to ensure that the two beams arrive back at the
same time.

Einstein also suggested that moving matter may create gravitational
waves that propogate through the universe at the speed of light.

If it were possible to build a Michelson-Morley experiment sensitive
enough to detect these waves then we ought to see a time difference
for light waves travelling parallel and perpendicular to a
gravitational wave.

The LIGO experiment is just such an experiment.   Two vaccuum tubes,
arranged in an L-shape, each tube 4km long.

time
====

It is just the beat of time, the beat that must go on.

Different viewpoints,

Different beat.

Same harmony.

But what exactly is time?

It seems that we can only go in one direction, we cannot go backwards
in time.

It also seems relentless, you cannot halt time.  Or maybe you can.

Einstein's special relativity showed that time and space are
intimately related, perhaps different aspects of the same thing?

Waves

Wherever you are in the universe, you are surrounded by gravity
waves.  Indeed, you yourself are just part of the waves.

Imagine a lattice of diamonds, each one wavelength of the frequency at
hand.

A black hole or two?
====================

Our universe is likely littered with black holes colliding with each
other.

And this is now late in the day, just a billion years ago.

So, let's begin and guess that our universe may have been born when
two masses, each roughly half the mass of our universe, merged into a
giant black hole.

The two, ying and yang perhaps, merged throwing a ripple through the
time of space as the energy swirled inside, a new infinite harmony.

Waves of almost equal amplitude, in every integer frequency of a
driving beat of time.

The waves of energy would swirl like swirls of raspberry juice in a
bowl of custard.

Vortices will form, as waves pass by and swirl in harmony.

A tiny gyroscop of mass, resonating with anything sharing the
channel.

Energy is conserved, so harmony is rewarded.

DNA

There is a lot of DNA on earth.  Each double helix strand has its own
rhythm.

What if DNA is everywhere it can be in the universe?

Why do cells grow differently from the same DNA?

As cells replicate in the womb new rhythms emerge.  As a body takes
shape the local vibrations will differ, activating different parts of
the DNA chain?

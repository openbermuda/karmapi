I began a previous `expanding.rst` by talking about *de Sitter space*
and saying::


   Within this space, time-like geodesics follow two distinct fields:
   expanding and contracting fields.


I received some feedback::
  

   I need to correct one major misunderstanding.  You write: "Within
   [de Sitter] space, time-like geodesics follow two distinct fields:
   expanding and contracting fields."  This is not correct.  De Sitter
   space is highly symmetric.  All geodesics are equivalent.  The
   dichotomy between expanding and contracting that you refer to only
   comes into play when you have an observer.  Like most of cosmology
   these concepts are observer dependent.

This turned out to be most helpful.

I was going to edit the  `expanding.rst` piece, but correcting things
round here that are not quite right would be a long project.

So a new piece is in order.

Outline
=======

*Perfect Copernican Principle (PCP)*::

  No particular location should be special.

  This should also be true of time as well as space

I like to think of this as *space is pretty much the same everywhere*.

Indeed, as we look into the heavens this does appear to be the case.
Spiral galaxies as far as the eye can see.

There is a peculiarity with red-shift in our observations.  The
further away a galaxy is the redder it looks.

Galaxies further away are moving faster and faster, the further away
they are?

How does this square with the PCP?

Short distances, Minkowski metric is fine.

Steer clear of black holes.


In [1] Colin Rourke shows that this is exactly what happens in *de
Sitter space*.



This piece takes things just a little further.




Static Universe

Expansion as an illusion

de Sitter Space

Gamma Ray Burst

Cosmic Microwave Background Radiation

Arriving and departing

=========================================

Observations would seem to show that our visible universe is saturated
with galaxies.

Each galaxy centred on a giant, super massive centre.

Our observations of this universe show this curious red shift, the
further away a light source is the greater the red shift.

Surely, this is just what we should expect, due to the inertial drag
caused by the intervening galaxies?

Each black hole, twisting and slowing time, giving the illusion of an
expanding universe.

Curious behaviour at the Hubble distance.

New arrivals and old friends.

Harmonics
=========

Magnetism and the speed of a stream of electrons?

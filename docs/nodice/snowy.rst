 White Noise
=============

Snowy the cat.  He brought me a rat.

And a mouse.  And lizards too.

A cat with secrets.

I help him with doors.

He has a special exit.

But the door is often open and there is often a human if not.

Say hello when I come home, ask me where I have been.

If there is something I want, I will let you know, but you can be
slow.

If there is something to see, I will take you there.

PiRi
====

One day Mary noticed eating faster than usual.

His bowl had been empty and she'd filled it again.

Glanced to the bowl and saw him their eating.
 
But white noise reduced and all of a blur.

PiRi was eating and Snowy not there.

What wouls snow do when he found his food eaten?

The same as he had done for maybe a day.

Shake a head, go ahead and eat what he needs.

Ubuntu for PiRi, but don't come to close.

You can greet with a nose, but then you can go.

I'll watch you play with the interpretter lock.

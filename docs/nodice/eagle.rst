So it goes like this.

Writing down thoughts, playing with rhymes and puzzles.

Riddles with answers or not.   Or riddles which answer themselves?

So lots here is simply quite wrong.  But the answer there will help to
show the way.

So check for assumptions, nearly right but not always, but maybe its
good enough?

reminds me it might be wrong...  did I mention that?

its like godel and math, somethings are true with no way to be sure

some can be true or false it doesn't matter, but no way to know

and some are true or false and can be proved to be so)

i think that should cover the legal disclaimer ;)   

wiki pedia might help and a good place to go to check leads and Leeds
too I guess, but don't go there::

  did i mention the legal disclaimer .. it might not be true there
  too, but its proved a good web of trust from wales...
  hmm... reminds me of jimmy from aber ga veni.  And Malcolm Nash and
  Garry Sobers....

another fun one... don't forget the legal disclaimer..

The tankrain rongo rongo show may really be a thing.

Round and round and side to side, up and down we go.

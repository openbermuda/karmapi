 Dear Colin
============

Thank you very much for taking the time to spend a morning together
recently.

It was good to be back at Warwick, I barely recognised it.

I left with much to think about the paradigm.

Einstein and universal time.

Why quasars are important.

Homogeneity of space time.
 
de Sitter space, inherently expansive as t increases, distance from
origin does too.

The de Sciama principle is wonderful in it's simplicity.

It captures the natural behaviour of waves.

It is noted that the inertial frame at a point is determined
predominantly by the distant matter in the universe: there is just so
much more of it and gravitational waves drop off only linearly with
distance.

The fundamental property of these waves is that any matter is moved by
that wave, two bodies exchange deltas at the speed of light.

The effect is for all matter to tend towards being in phase with it's
surroundings.

Now while the background inertial field is of considerable interest,
what affects us locally is the delta of our inertial field, relative
to the universal background.

This delta is dominated by the local matter and so by moving in harmony
can help sustain each other.

Our window on our universe
==========================

We see a window of 13 billion years, or maybe we see much more?

Is the visible universe all there is or is it in a state of constant
re-birth?

It appears to be extraordinarily uniform, based on existing
observations.

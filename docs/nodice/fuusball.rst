A foosball table in the kitchen

2014 October the nth.

Hurricane Fay, a saturday night.

Tropical storm at a 100 miles.

No need to bother bermuda strong.

Woke a night snow in fright.

A bang a clout

Cedar bent at pi by 3

Lights gone out

Back to bed.

Up at 8

Go for a walk

Trees down

Saws run

Cables down, a flash at a pole.

Off to the north

To swear to the queen

But the bird wont fly

Til the runways dry

Back the next day



Off to the cold

The red and white

O canada

A new birthday in the maple land.

Back for gonzalo

No power, a guitar and the snow.

Tips from friends

To save a life.

Changing the strings and playing guitar

Amazing grace

As tree frogs daze.

Back for more, a crash behind.

Another big tree, takes a knee.

No power but torches and henry viii

Away at a friends

Walking the dog that never walks far

Feeding the cat that never is seen

Blood on the carpet

No word from good company

But letters lawyers

Power at home

A tiny move 5 * 3 to 13, lucky for some.

Snowy is here, now three years on.

3.14... to a transcendental heaven

Here is Piri, dividing by pi.

You said that you wished you'd handled it better

But for me you would make an exception.

Another letter, from a proxy.

I see what you do.

Home from the hospital, do you care?

Well here's a filly, I hope you use it.

For if you don't you'll surely lose it.

The rules have changed, the game is new.

Skill is required and judgement too.

But mostly skill and a vision and an honest heart.

Good, better, best.

Will you ever be good?

Surely can be better,

But the better wont be best until you share with the rest.

Stop with the proxies.

Do you have it in you then join me too?

Fork and pull, push add commit.

Add some more, commit and push.

commit and push

a status check

a diff is good

and there's always git show.

I know I'm a git

I'm a Sheffield boy

Born at the zoo with only one dog.

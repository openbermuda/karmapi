==================
 Gamma Ray Bursts
==================

I am continuing to enjoy Colin Rourke's, "A new paradigm for the
universe".

*Appendix G: Gamma Ray Bursts* has my focus at the moment.

It is a summary of a joint paper with R MacKay::

  Are gamma-ray bursts optical illusions?

  Palestinian J Math 5(Spec.1) (2016) 175--197

You can find it on the web:

* http://msp.warwick.ac.uk/~cpr/paradigm/GammaRayBursts.pdf

I am finding the mathematics heavy going, but the commentary and the
ideas are making sense intuitively, at least if I am understanding
things correctly.

The paper posits that gamma ray bursts are in fact the result of an
emitter, that has been invisible to us for an essentially infinite [1]
amount of time, suddenly becomes visible.

The emitter is assumed(?) to be adjacent to a black hole, a point in
space time where time is slowed by the intense gravitational field.

View a black hole as a place where time slows down.

As such it acts as a giant capacitor, storing up energy before
releasing a burst to the surrounding universe.

================
 No Van No Rest
================

I'm coming the the van eh?

But not with a van

An advance party

Checking it out

With a guitar

And a cat carrier too

Full of magic

From Pi Ree and Snow

Coming to the snow in the north

From bmd to Ron in toe

Then up the 4

17 to a belle

ville

Through cumber land and geordie too

Wit there by to see.

Through Darl McLied

In Darling Tonne

And a vale

Pick a ring

Up through tweed

3 and 8 or 3 times 8, what's that about?

Then onto the 7

To scotland for a p in p

No tape to c, but maybe there is?

Always with mj to guide

and gm too, and bmg, they're a quantum pair

With ds and hs too, another quantum pair.

Meet with dr and er and the ee, eh aaaah hell

not hell but heaven with l

To a van with a dell and

a deck of cards

with fine five dice

with ron and go

and go and run

and a scot at bank on bank

with k and gm to guide

273 4 297

I need a new phone, now there's a

a 613 number to juggle

can someone write the code?

no pull required

just go have fun

fork is the way to go.

Here's an advance wave

returning via king edward

for g and i

in toe ron too

always with mmmmmm to guide

Next wave coming soon

just check the cat forecast

when's the snow coming?

to a place that has no van?

spring m from the castle

east of a shire in devon

trojan horses of love

disguised as russian dolls

a pass the parcel show

i hope she sees it

because she wrote the script

or rather gmd and bmg did

with ds and hs as the

data and mg

providers

of die a grams of venn

of arrows

but where is galois?

no worry just

give him a thing that resists

and a tiny battery

to store what's there

what's that whining?

a coil perhaos?

crystal set

and a line to the cherry tree

caroline

at 2am

tiger feet

i liked it

ab

and ba

dancing q

but who could forget, what a loo?

dancing down the staird

an artful aarvark

with so many ehs a?

I wish I could spell it

Forgot the d.

Only one D?

but there's a b and d

was there a c?

surely there was must ask er.

with love its jar

remove the g

it makes it pi times slower

but going there slower

and riding the waves

gets you there faster

in the end

the end...

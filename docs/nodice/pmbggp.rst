Its 3 am

All en u c

At the ren

re road

with the door of gold

PM at the dock

And the gates

not bill but R

And who's this singing?

It's George

The Papa

with the dope

on the dopes.

Removing the G

its over to you

M + 1 to the EN

That's you of course

My own QM

Coming with a letter

from a to z

At the field of kind

A lee by the sea

I'll be there at 5 or maybe 6

Will you be my qm?

We're removing the g

and the i and the l

So its over to you

Not a moment too soon

M+1 to the N, qm.

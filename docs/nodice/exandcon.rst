 Expanding and contracting
===========================

*de Sitter space* is proposed in [1] as a model for the universe.

Within this space, time-like geodesics follow two distinct fields:
expanding and contracting fields.


[Incorrect at the second sentence see [2] for follow up..

This is perhaps one of the harder parts of the theory to picture.

Satelite loops of water vapour in the earth's atmosphere may help with
this.

Find an area where there is a tropical cyclone, and note how it both
sucks in moisture from the surroundings, with a distinct in-flow as
well as a distinct outflow.

A strong cyclone viewed from space has a striking resemblence to a
spiral galaxy.

A fuller 3-dimensional view would look more like a cooling tower,
it's base, at ocean level, sucking in matter and it's top, up in the
atmosphere, ejecting the same, with a whirling vortex in between.

So imagine instead of a thin slice of the earth's atmposphere, the
picture is a just a slice of a giant three dimensional space of
galaxies.

Each cyclone, now a galaxy.

Now we see how the giant masses at the galactic centres suck in matter
from the surroundings, way beyond the visible galaxy.  In essence,
they clear space, allowing light to pass.

Now the progess of that light is modulated by the intervening matter,
the vast majority of which lies at the centre of, or close to, a galaxy.

So what of the increasing red shift as we get deeper into the universe,
does that not mean that those galaxies are receding faster?

Is not that just how space time works, when you saturate it with giant
rotating masses?

Remember the universe is saturated, in fact appears to be in an almost
perfect equilibrium, like clouds of water vapour in our atmosphere.

Surely it is just the case, the further light travels the more it is
red shifted by the intervening matter?  An inertial drag that matter
has on space time?

Now how does this all square with gamma ray bursts?

The distortion of space time that giant masses create is more complex
than described above, it contains both expansive and contractive
fields.

One way to look at this is imaging a 3-dimentsional lattice, with
nodes of the lattice evenly spaced.

Pick a point and apply a twist to the lattice.   This distorts the
lattice near the twisting point, lattice cubes become lozenge shaped.

Overall, the contractions and expansions of the lattice balance out,
or rather they serve to provide an overall expansion in space, a world
within worlds.

Now photons following the contractive field will tend to bunch up, in
effect they are blue shifted.  When we observe the result of this,
light from a source generated over billions of years, arrives in a
very short period of time, before reverting to the expanding field (it
is not possible for a gamma ray burst to last a long period of time
without breaking causality.

A stream of photons from beyond the Hubble distance ends up slowed to
a crawl by the intervening matter, so it bursts on the scene, then
rapidly decays to a distant red?

When our path crosses such a stream we get the rapid burst before
things settle down and we have a new distant arrival.

Why so?   The intervening matter modulates the signal, adds harmonics?

Further note that there is evidence from the harmonics in the CMB that
space time is tidal.  We should factor out these tides to help our
understanding of the observations we see.

Returning to cyclones, it is worth further noting the space where this
all takes place: a thin shell, above the earth's surface.

One dimension of time, two of space and a thin slice of a third
dimension.   Harmonics emerge around the globe.

At the surface matter moving with the earth, but at the edge of space,
starting to move with space itself, or at least closer to the local
inertial field, away from some of the spin.

Space time?
===========

Here I am concerned, primarily, with the propogation of light through
space time.

Making these assumptions:

* matter both modulates and defines the space time through which light
  travels.
  
* in the language of [1] it creates inertial frames which define the
  geodesics for electromagnetic waves to follow.

* the universe is pretty much the same everywhere.

* local galaxy velocities of around 300 km/3, or about c * 10-3, where
  c is the spee of light.

* a rotating mass drags the inertial field by amound proportional to
  the mass times its angular velocity, that drops of with the 1/R
  where R is the distance from the mass.

* the universe is almost exactly  saturated, in the sense that its
  volume is equal to the total volume of space we get by summing the
  space associated with each galaxy.

* this latter we do by summing the volume over which each galaxy's
  field remains contractive.

Less precisely, but hopefully more intuitively, take for example our
sun.  There is a point in space where matter is beyond the sun's
influence.   Inside this radius, matter can (and does) slowly drift
inward towards the sun.  Outside it just drifts by and moves further
and further away.   It is the same with galaxies, but they come with
10**10 or more solar masses at the centre.

The point of all this is that all light passing through the universe
is spending much of it's journey having its passage modulated by some
nearby galaxy.

Now this modulation is what we call the expansion of space time.  It
is an expansion, in the sense that the mass in the region is twisting
the fabric in on itself, space in a sense is denser, like an Escher
painting.

As light travels through this fabric it is inevitably slowed and
shifted to the red.

Then there is lensing to consider.   Not only will the intervening
matter modulate the signal, it will change it's direction and focus
the signal.

What we observe here on earth is the sum over time of the modulations
of the incoming wave.  Much of the time we just see the low glow of
the cosmic microwave background,  stretched out photons that zoom by.

But as we fall into the same path as a focussed beam and we too follow
that beam, then we see a gamma ray burst.

The merger of our path with some source can, and general is, a
dramatic event.
  
Postscript
==========

For some while I have been puzzling over how the universe is could be
in a steady state, with balanced expanding and contracting fields.

I had been focussing on the gamma ray bursts and representing new
arrivals in our visible universe, but puzzling why all arrivals are so
distance and things could possibly be in balance?

Now things make sense.  The redshift is just an artifact of matter.

I also note that the interpretation of

Status Update
=============

On the software side, I have split some parts of karmapi off into
another project, I am calling *blume*.

I've found a great library for doing simple harmonic analysis.

I've successfully used that to do transforms on global temperature
data and started to fit models.

I'm literally going round in circles with *blume*, juggling Balls with
graphs and queues too.

Once I have this magic working then I can get back to plotting and
simulating galaxies.

I've been following the ongoing LIGO and Virgo runs.  See here::

  https://gracedb.ligo.org/latest

As far as I can tell, neutron star merges have been pretty rare so
far.

There has also been a lack of events where coincident observations,
such as gamma ray bursts, have been made.

Sky localisation is now routine for events with some excellent
exhibits being produced::

All this stuff is working using triangulation based on time
differences of arrival at the three detectors in operation.

It all looks very sound.   Note the two above look to be at about the
same time and coming from the same part of the sky, but that is just
because detector sensitivity varies according to the current
orientation of the detectors to that part of the sky.  [aside:
important to know more about this to better understand variations in
detection rates].

Not only do we get the coordinates, we get pretty good distance
estimates.  Which should help those looking for nearby galaxies.

Further, this in turn will help refine estimations of the Hubble
constant. 

However, I think that rather than being the source of the signal, we
are finding the location of the lens that focussed the signal.

Which recalls something I read about short and long gamma ray bursts::

  We present a detailed investigation of Hubble Space Telescope
  rest-frame UV/optical observations of 22 short gamma-ray burst (GRB)
  host galaxies and sub-galactic environments. Utilizing the high
  angular resolution and depth of HST we characterize the host galaxy
  morphologies, measure precise projected physical and host-normalized
  offsets between the bursts and host centers, and calculate the
  locations of the bursts with respect to their host light
  distributions (rest-frame UV and optical). We calculate a median
  short GRB projected physical offset of 4.5 kpc, about 3.5 times
  larger than that for long GRBs, and find that ≈25% of short GRBs
  have offsets of >= 10 kpc.

  When compared to their host sizes, the median offset is 1.5
  half-light radii (re ), about 1.5 times larger than the values for
  long GRBs, core-collapse supernovae, and Type Ia supernovae. In
  addition, ≈20% of short GRBs having offsets of >= 5re , and only
  ≈25% are located within 1re.

  We further find that short GRBs severely under-represent their
  hosts' rest-frame optical and UV light, with ≈30%-45% of the bursts
  located in regions of their host galaxies that have no detectable
  stellar light, and ≈55% in the regions with no UV light.

  Therefore, short GRBs do not occur in regions of star formation or
  even stellar mass. This demonstrates that the progenitor systems of
  short GRBs must migrate from their birth sites to their eventual
  explosion sites, a signature of kicks in compact object binary
  systems. Utilizing the full sample of offsets, we estimate natal
  kick velocities of ≈20-140 km s–1. These independent lines of
  evidence provide the strongest support to date that short GRBs
  result from the merger of compact object binaries (NS-NS/NS-BH).
  
  We calculate a median short GRB projected physical offset of 4.5
  kpc, about 3.5 times larger than that for long GRBs, and find that
  ≈25% of short GRBs have offsets of >= 10 kpc. When compared to their
  host sizes, the median offset is 1.5 half-light radii (re ), about
  1.5 times larger than the values for long GRBs,

The paragraph beginning *Therefore,* can largely be ignored, other
than noting that GRBs do not sem to occur in regions of star
formation.

What is happening is light from a distant galaxy being focussed by the
so called *host* galaxies.

Longer gamma ray bursts are typically 1.5 light radii away from
galactic centre, with short gamma ray bursts 4.5 light radii away.

This is to be expected, the more powerful long bursts are in part a
result of the more intense lensing closer to the galactic centre.

I believe we may well be seeing the same phenomenom with gravitational
waves.

Summary
=======

It is important to keep in mind that the light waves that we see from
distant galaxies are just that, photons on a journey from a distant
source.

The fact that these arrive tired, and red-shifted tells us their
journey has been expansive, in short the intervening matter is
creating an expansive field as far as light propogation is concerned.

Now think of a distant source, think of it in its terms, trying to
shine a torch on earth.   

At some point it is so far from earth it can't reach it.   Or rather,
source and destination are swirling around too much and any photons
get blurred out.


Addendum
========

From wikipedia::

    According to calculations, the current comoving distance—proper
    distance, which takes into account that the universe has expanded
    since the light was emitted, to particles from which the cosmic
    microwave background radiation (CMBR) was emitted, which
    represents the radius of the visible universe, is about 14.0
    billion parsecs (about 45.7 billion light-years), while the
    comoving distance to the edge of the observable universe is about
    14.3 billion parsecs (about 46.6 billion light-years),[10] about
    2% larger.

    https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observable_universe#Size

The author is distinguishing between the current distance to the
objects that emitted the CMBR we see today, noting that due to
continued expansion etc.

And the distance to the edge of the observable universe.

The author is looking at things from a big bang perspective and the
assumption that the CMBR is how things were just 380,000 years after
the big bang.

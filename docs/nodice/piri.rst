=====================
 Another quantum cat
=====================

A few days ago I woke up and queen mary informed me that we had a
visitor.

A tiny kitten that had been eating out of snowy's bowl.

In every way, a smaller version of snowy, roughly 1/3 the size, no
matter what you measure.

In the last few weeks we had decided it was time to move back to
Canada.

But there was always the problem of the snow.

Here in Bermuda, most winter days it makes it to 20C.

Snowy, despite his name has never seen snow.

He's seen wind and rain and hurricanes too.   But no snow.

So we learned that you can take a cat in the air, beneath your seat in
a plane.

And end up in Toronto, with snow in a nylon nest.

What could possibly go wrong.

So we take out the cat carrier, and place it in the living room.

And snowy likes it, or mayb the catnip sprinkled on its floor.

And then on the 7th of the 10th month and Piri is here.

The name came from Mary.  A tiny pirate, found a new home on an
island.

And he likes the travel nest too, it mush be the catnip... though that
has started to thin.

Piri is white like snowy, but a black patch on one eye, just like a
pirate?

He is hungry and eats fast so he can retreat a safe distance.

So two cats on a plane, what could possibly go wrong.

But the bigger question is does snowy like piri?

To piri snowy is magic.  He finds cool places to sleep in the day.  He
brings mice, birds and rats in the night.

He let Piri eat from his bowl and drink water too.

Their noses brush, no purr, no growl.

Fish for a treat, Piri alone.   Learns to come close.

And slowly by slowly pulls bits from your hand.

Snowy returns and looks on in mirth at this new ball of energy.

Goes for his food and piri comes too..  a hiss and piri retreats.

Lies on the floor and watches snow eat.

So snowy says piri stays

But neither of them knows of the snow days ahead.

Names
=====

Harvey, Irma, Jose too.

Maria and now Ophelia.

Mexico quake and California fire.

Bagpuss first, then Tiger and Blackie.  Maple and Jessie and Walter
too.

Snowy and Sooty and Snowy again.

And now snowy junior, aka Piri.

Cats come in ones and twos.

Storms too nowadays.

Harvy, Jose, Katia, Lee and Maria.

Pairs and threes sometimes, running at the same time.

Feeding each other, repelling too.

And raising the swell with a moon at eclipse.

The seas have been pumping and are hotter than hot.

And now far to the north and eastward too, a hurricane named Ophelia.

Seas cooler than normal, for hurricanes here.

But cold in the upper atmosphere too.   A nice little heat engine.

Limited sheer, its that time of year.

How cat insurance works
=======================

If you live in an area where natural catastrophes occur then there is
a risk that your home may suffer serious damage from time to time.


Depending on how risky your area you may be able to take insurance to
cover this risk.

If you have a mortgage, then you may be obliged to take insurance to
protect the lender from the risk of catastrophic loss to your home.

Reinsurance
===========

So an insurer that insures a lot of properties in an area exposed to
natural catastrophes may start to get concerned that it might not be
able to honour its obligations. 

They can handle the small attritional losses that home owners are
exposed, but do not have the capital to cover large catastrophes.

So they go to a broker who helps them understand the risks they are
exposed to and who has friendly reinsurers who can help with the burden.

Models
======

So out come the models and in go the numbers.

Out come more numbers, what the losses might be.

Look what is expected.

Add some more for what might be.

And of course you cover your costs.

The broker too and the tax man too.

So that's the premium, where the money comes from.

Profit
======

Nine out of ten, the year is quiet.  Disasters afar, but not hurting
me.

Collect the profit and throw again.

Invest
======

Some profit is invested, it brings more return.

And raises the rating and access to premium.

But others did well too, just at the same time.

So the premiums are dropping, but not how you think.

The number is the same, but the denominator changed.


Loss
====

The year it is ten, two groups of five.

The losses come in.

One Harvey might be big.

And Irma too.

A little from Jose, which stayed out at sea.

Katia rained too, down Mexico way.

And then came Maria to Puerto Rico.

An earthquake in Mexico too.

And wild fires in California.

Ophelia too, will she sail by the coast?

Winter is coming.


Models
======

This storm is a monster like never before seen.

It is a one in 500, 100 at least.

Here comes another, 100 too.

So what is the chance of 3 or 4?

And those reinstatements?  The third and fourth were free.

And that forest fire, too small to notice.  Well there is a clause in
the contract: one big event triggers all losses are covered.

The models are expensive, millions to rent.

Full of good numbers to rent?
t
So the modellers go to work and find an event or three, like the ones
that just happened.

Run the numbers and announce a loss estimate.

Forgetting to model the things they can't model.  Because the model is
a model and won't do everything.

Adjustment
==========

The home owners call the agents attend.  To see what disaster is there
to behold.

Four feet of water, and more in the basement.  I'm sorry we don't
cover water.

But the wind did damage too, the roof and the windows and some of the
water, well that is how it can enter.

The agents are swamped, paddling from home to home.

Cars are awash, in lots everywhere.   There will be a bill there.

And businesses too, who do get flood cover and payments for breaks in
business.

So the insurer sees that the cat layer is reached.   The broker will
see that the loss passes over.

So now the agents they can seek good will, from the people they know
from the visits to homes.

And the neighbours have found a clause here and there and soon all
know how to play the double agent.

So the losses they climb.

And the models announce they have found it this time, that thing they
have been missing is clear finally.

Dividing by zero
================

So ten years ago the premium was paid.

The loss came and it was paid too.

But in case of another a small new premium, to cover what remains of
the season.

Except this year there were four and two were free.

Oh, and the deal is for three years.  Next year everything counts.
And the premium is locked in.

But the models being used cannot model it so.  We don't really know
what the risk is right now.

Reserves
========

So insurers cover other things too.  All sorts of things that might go
wrong.

A cover is for a year, but 20 years for lawyers to argue.  While the
premium gains interest, while held in reserve.

As each event arrives an assessment is made.  How much to reserve for
the losses to come?

Tax
===

One thing to consider is how big was the profit?

So if you have a big profit, a good time to check the reserves.

Top them up a bit, you just got lucky.

But how much to top up for cat?  The cat is a quantum cat, there or
not there.  Loss comes in quanta.

Each company has a wavelength in dollars.  $150M,  $250M.

And little waves too.  10M, 50M.

And bigger harmonies, $1B, $2B.

And they feedback and add up.

But for now, lets see how things are going, throw some guesses in and
find a number.  That's the new reserve.

And the extra is tax free for now.


Ratings and Regulation
======================

Message from snowy, make of it what you will: you7887

So there are credit ratings.  Roughly the probability you won't pay in
full.

With a probability too that you won't pay at all.

And there are formal agencies that do ratings snp and standpoor and
mystical names of yore.

But there are informal ratings too, captain cowboy's a pirate and piri
too.

The information flows, make of it what you will.

And often the truth is delayed and comes with another half truth.

But delay is a friend as we can see how it goes.

Go with the flow, staying afloat?

Reinstatement
=============

So after a time and after an event the clocks and the counters are
reset.

Reserve is fixed, capital too.  A promise here, a future loss too?
The game begins at each renewal.

Renewal
=======

Jan 1, April 1, June 1.

Magic dates, but Jan 1 is king.

60% in harmony here.

The coffers are full, who wants to play cat lotto?

Now the stakes have been shuffled.

Deductables dropped, new limits imposed.

The Players and the game
========================

Players
=======

Writing premium.

Waiting for losses.

A plan for the losses?

Who needs a plan?

Who has a plan?

Incentives
==========

It is all about the dollar.

You have a slice of the company pie.

And promises of slices if things they go well.

Grow the pie, you do well, but how to grow the pie?

And remember delay, that block in the pipe.

That slows the information flow.

Models
======

The models are wrong, its part of the design.

Magic Division
==============

Never define that which you model.

The hundred year loss, for any cat model.

So according to the model, for whatever it covers, that is the number
one year in a hundred.

Now there is some range of error, but not too precise.

There is 50 and 20, 10 and 5 two.

Each with precision, rarely uncertain.

And when rare things happen all too frequently

Change the divisor and move on quite happily.

Climate Change
==============

The climate is changing, it always has.

And now its changing faster, because of us.

2 million years life burnt in 200.

Now it takes time to catch up, but catch up it does.

The engine is started, the oceans are roaring.

On land change too, more rain or more dryness and sometimes the same.

More varied, just greater, but not like it was.

The models are tuned to what's in the past.

Taking a window where things are quite flat.

And ignoring the slope of the mountain they are climbing.

Looking at signal plus noise, not modelling the signal.

Fear Uncertainty Doubt
======================

The players they see good times year on year.

Some little scares, a strange one here, a cyber breach?

But then they find they can guess the risk and take a chance on the
data of yore.

After a time the mind it plays games.

The players get richer.   They give more slack.

Hoping that they are the one with the luck.

Feedback
========

The climate gives feedback, it strengthens itself.

A new harmony for a new energy.

The land it is shaped by this very same power.

It will adapt, but ripple forever.

How big is the ripple and can we just ride it?

Or will it surround us and drown us in hubris?


Who has the information?
========================

We can simulate this.

Should we do it together?

PiRi is with us.  Are you with us too?

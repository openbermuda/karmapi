=====================
 Another quantum cat
=====================

A few days ago I woke up and queen mary informed me that we had a
visitor.

A tiny kitten that had been eating out of snowy's bowl.

In every way, a smaller version of snowy, roughly 1/3 the size, no
matter what you measure.

In the last few weeks we had decided it was time to move back to
Canada.

But there was always the problem of the snow.

Here in Bermuda, most winter days it makes it to 20C.

Snowy, despite his name has never seen snow.

He's seen wind and rain and hurricanes too.   But no snow.

So we learned that you can take a cat in the air, beneath your seat in
a plane.

And end up in Toronto, with snow in a nylon nest.

What could possibly go wrong.

So we take out the cat carrier, and place it in the living room.

And snowy likes it, or mayb the catnip sprinkled on its floor.

And then on the 7th of the 10th month and Piri is here.

The name came from Mary.  A tiny pirate, found a new home on an
island.

And he likes the travel nest too, it mush be the catnip... though that
has started to thin.

Piri is white like snowy, but a black patch on one eye, just like a
pirate?

He is hungry and eats fast so he can retreat a safe distance.

So two cats on a plane, what could possibly go wrong.

But the bigger question is does snowy like piri?

To piri snowy is magic.  He finds cool places to sleep in the day.  He
brings mice, birds and rats in the night.

He let Piri eat from his bowl and drink water too.

Their noses brush, no purr, no growl.

Fish for a treat, Piri alone.   Learns to come close.

And slowly by slowly pulls bits from your hand.

Snowy returns and looks on in mirth at this new ball of energy.

Goes for his food and piri comes too..  a hiss and piri retreats.

Lies on the floor and watches snow eat.

So snowy says piri stays

But neither of them knows of the snow days ahead.

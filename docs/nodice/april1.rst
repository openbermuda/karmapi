 Who knew moving was complicated?

It has been a while since I last wrote.

In the meanwhile I have had a chance to go through the whole book in
some detail.

I have a very good grasp of chapters 1-3 and much of 4 at this point.

The more descriptive chapters: observations and cosmology are much
easier to follow, at least for me.

A fascinating book.

I dug out a pdf of Sciama's 1953 paper that you reference.

inertial drag, does god play dice or is music inevitable?

It is good to revisit this, indeed it perhaps should have been paid
more attention at the time.

Or perhaps it was.  There was a lot going on.

My own thoughts are around the area of just how matter, will vibrate
in harmony with the surrounding vibrations in the universe.

Indeed I think this is just how the mathematics actually 
works, at least for certain \omega.

At this point it would be invaluable to spend a few hours together if
we can resolve our own space/time coordinate issues.

I think if one of us is dense enough and spins fast enough then
something might happen?

I am happy to be the dense spinning bit for a while.

All the best.

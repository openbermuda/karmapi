====================================
 N green bottles, dancing in a pool
====================================

It started with none.

It was good.  A place to relax with noodles too.

And then a construction of plastic and trash.

With green pipes of water and noodles too.

A bottle of water, a fountain for you.

A crystal garden, a giant storm.

A mountain fountain, pure and cold.

Into the bottle, warm in the rays.

Then trickle and flow to the swamp down below.

Cascade down the pillar, the green can too.

Flow through the towel, in harmony.

Out of the noodle into the pool.

Driving the wheel, beating the mana.

Spinning and stopping, starting and sleeping.

Back in the mountains, giant bowls of ice.

Plastic and paper, even some rice

Mixing and syncing ready to pour.

Adding more water

Bucket by bucket

2 weeks of learning and still figuring it out.

Guests came to visit, we sat by the pool and talked of how ice can 
turn into energy to power a digital phone.

Of pi and micro, bit and byte.

And they brought water, bubbles too.

Mostly of green but some yellow or orange.

Up in the mountains, in great lakes of ice.

One day I took one for a float in the pool.

Sat in the sun, with waves all around.

Opened the bottle, and now we had pool + 1.

Slowly the gas left.

30 minutes, ready to sync.

And off it went to walk to orongo.

1 + 1
=====

Once you have one then you have left the beginning.  Divide by the
previous and you throw an exception.

The hare must add 1, so now there are two.

Green bottles walking in my pool.

1 + 1 + 1
=========

The hare is away and now there are three.

This one took a while to get from the quary.

But ran down to join the other two.

The tortoise is resting, it is feeling the heat.
 
Drained by the talk of the hare.

2 o 2
=====

With three you can get four and all kinds of two.

And four sets of three with one to score.

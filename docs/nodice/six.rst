 My Perfect Cousin
===================

6 just perfect, but what does that mean?

1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 1 + 2 + 3 = 1 * 2 * 3

A cricket match at aber ga glenny.

Sobers and Nash, six sixes each.

I heard a talk, maybe lightning in the sea.

About taking a text and boiling it down to the essence.

It was better than that more fun.

In the end what popped out was just six words.

So that's about the length of a commit

Give a take a bit of a plank.

But its a good place to start

If it pulls you in

Don't be afraid

Some of the deltas are quite small

It might not be doing what you hoped it would do

But its software and free, so you can play too.

 Who Killed JFK?
=================

Its DD-n,  eh eh Day 6?

Its 4 in the morning, somewhere.

Will Donny open the box?

Or take the money?

If I know Donny its both.

A D Day in Dallas

Was the Tall Bot write

When he wrote about chess

And teh plot of the Dull

Less for the see, eye

And eh?

And teh oil and steel

And teh team of stirrers too

With generals of course

Upset by the bay

Where the pigs went awry

Or was it the dad of Tom Cruise?

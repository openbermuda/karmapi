So I am reading a brief history of time.

MJ sent me four books::

  Kick Off, James Wragg

  A new paradigm for the universe, Colin Rourke

  A brief history of time, Stephen Hawking

  Cloughie, Walking on Water, My Life


She's that good.

Oh and she even managed to include a small cardboard box, which would
have been even better had it contained what it was intended for.

But the books were just perfect.

I take Colin everywhere for now.

His book, and Fred Hoyle's too have been an excellent way to get up to
speed with the thinking in cosmology.

It has always both intrigued and mystified me.

Through my life black holes have gone from something on Star Trek to
potentially the key drivers of the universe.

I wonder if cosmology faces a crisis a little like mathematics went
through int the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries when axiomatics
was born.

As far as cosmology is concerned, mathematics may be part of the
problem.

The mathematics of both general relativity and quantum mechanics are
both complex and subtle.

And we know both are incomplete models that are nonetheless very good
models much of the time.

Theoretical physics advances as its practitioners explore the
consequences of the mathematics of the various theories.

Sometimes things get stretched a bit too far.

Black holes are one such place.

They are tiny, so according to general relativity, they take no space
at all.

But the strangeness that is quantum phenomena generates a whole set of
strange questions in the context of black holes.

Heisenberg says we cannot know its position and its velocity beyond
some amount of certainty.

It is my belief that the boundaries between black holes and the
surrounding universe will likely have many layers, like the atmosphere
of a giant planet.

This would be what Colin Rourke refers to as a generator belt.

================================
 The cat in the box on the gate
================================

What was its name?

It waited each day.

4pm or was it 4 and forty?

Jack a nory, what a story?

Home from school.

On the carpet.

Rhythm of a voice.

Willie Wonker, Bernard Cribbins.

Music too, but what are the words?

What does it mean?  Why does it matter?

What do they know and hope to show?

I didnt know then

Nor do I now.

With every answer, another puzzle.

A bus stop shelter

With a railway sign.

No railway platform

A train on the way

With ET and S

And the cat in the box at the gate.

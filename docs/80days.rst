 Eighty Days
=============

A plan for eighty days.::

  2 ^ 4 * 5

So lots of pairs.  An hour a day?

Work on the bit that interests most.

So let's start with some assumptions.

The visible universe is remarkably uniform.

Gravitational waves exist.

As matter rotates relative to its background space, it disturbs the
background gravitational field.

If we assume the magnitude falls off linearly with distance.

This is intended just to boot-strap an argument.

de Sciama says the intertial field at a point is defined by::

  I = sum ( m_k * owega_k / r_k)

In words, the effect is proportional to the mass of the body and
inversely proportional to its distance away.

This *omega* thing you can view as the effect this blob of matter has
on the inertial field, as it rides the waves.

Assertion 1
-----------

::
   
   Any matter moving (rotating) relative to it's inertial frame sends
   out a gravitational wave that matches the extent to whith it is out
   of phase with its inertial frame.

   If it actually manages to align itself with the inertial frame then
   it will disappear in a burst of energy directed along the angle of
   alignment.

   As a wave of frequency as determined by Planck's constant.


Matter
------

In symmetry, it makes sense to view matter as a standing wave of the
frequency determined by Planck::

          e = mc^2 = hf

===========================
 A Theory of Waves in Time
===========================

It's all waves, gravitational waves.

A field that propogates through itself.

Local resonance and structure.

Celestial harmony.

Setting
=======

Imagine a void.   A cube of None marching through time.

The cube cut into 8 smaller cubes, in turn each 8 smaller.

And so on all the way down.

Make the edges of the cubes vibrate, with the frequency inversely
proportional to the length of the cube side.

Have the energy for each frequency be some magic constant multiple of
the frequency.

The strings are perfectly elastic, so the vibrations pass through the
void at the speed of light.

When a wave passes, a cube offers resistance, inertia, that has to be
overcome to move it.

Below a certain threshold, the cube is pulled back by the fabric of
time.


Water
=====

Add a drop of water to the void.

Two protons dancing round 8 friends.

H20, 47b, its everywhere here.


Schrodinger's Cat
=================

What is an observation?

An observation is when energy is turned into momentum or vice-versa.

So when is the observation made in this experiment?

A photon enters the box, passes through the half mirror...

What's momentum
===============

mass * velocity

Oh and there is a law of conservation of momentum.


What is energy?
===============

A gravitational wave.

A change in energy, changes the waves.

momentum times ache gives the energy.

and frequency is proportional to momentum too.


Gravitational field
===================

Matter, which is itself just gravitational waves.

Waves running in circles and eights and more, gyroscopes in the sky.

Gyroscopes
==========

Bouncing along the waves, creating waves as they pass.

What is mass?
=============

Mass is a standing wave of energy in the fabric of space time.

A gyroscope that pulls as you pull.

Einstein
========

Einstein guessed gravitational waves may be a thing.  Two years ago,
they were detected, they are a thing.


Planck
======

Planck had a constant named after him.   They call it *h*.

When energy, in the form of photons, is created the frequency of the
photon is linearly proportional to the momentum.

It is also linearly proportional to the ??


Neutrons
========

There are lot of these about round here.   Or things that can be
rearranged into neutrons, and yield energy.



Resonance and Harmony
=====================

Imagine being inside a recently formed black hole.  A chaotic  
implosion of matter.

Matter which is moving and hence generating gravitational waves.

A random distribution of white noise.

Locally, there may be vibrations at the same frequency.

Harmonics will emerge.

Perhaps the resulting distribution of energy will follow a harmonic
distribution.

The total amount of energy in a given frequency being proportional to
that frequency itself.

This distribution of energy in the universe's gravitational field
would give rise naturally to the quantum phenomena and in particular
give rise to the Planck-Einstein relation, *E = hf*.


Background
==========

Mean gravitational field, varies in time.

Time
====

??

Dark Matter
===========

Local areas of structure within the field, below the noise.

But you will get in sync if you pass by.


Quantum crypto
==============

Agreeing a local field structure below the noise.

Quantum computer
================

Look for structure in hidden field.


Karma
=====

Waves that a body creates bounce back as they harmonise with the
universe around.


Godel, Escher, Bach
===================

Self reference.


Incompleteness of mathematics
=============================

Mathematics of self referential fields.


Predictions
===========

Dark matter
-----------

Black holes which have evaporated.

Areas of wonderful hidden structure we can only see if we pass
through?

Lenses that focus gravitational waves.

Water
-----

under the electron microscope.

Homeopathy?   DIY homeopathy?

Diagnose the planet with sea samples under electron microscope?

Moon and planets
----------------


Does God play dice?
-------------------

If so how does the game go?


Gravitational decay rate
------------------------

When two black holes spiral into each other how near can you be to
watch?

Number of wavelengths away before you barely notice?


Probably OK so long as you don't get sucked in, you are already along
for the ride and have been for some time...


Therefore, field would seem to be extremely homogeneous, as noted,
time seems to be similar for lots of places in our universe.

There can be big local explosions and nobody notices.

It will follow a harmonic distribution.

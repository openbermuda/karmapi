=============================
 A Quantum Theory of Gravity
=============================

It's all waves, gravitational waves.

A field that propogates through itself.

Local resonance and structure.

Celestial harmony.

Water
=====

Two protons dancing round 8 friends.


Schrodinger's Cat
=================

What is an observation?

An observation is when energy is turned into momentum or vice-versa.

So when is the observation made in this experiment?

A photon enters the box, passes through the half mirror...


What's momentum
===============

mass * velocity

Oh and there is a law of conservation of momentum.


What is energy?
===============

A gravitational wave.

Gravitational field
===================

Matter, which is itself just gravitational waves.

Gyroscopes
==========

Bouncing along the waves, creating waves.

What is mass?
=============

Einstein
========

Einstein guessed gravitational waves may be a thing.  Two years ago,
they were detected, they are a thing.



Planck
======

Planck had a constant named after him.   They call it *h*.

When energy, in the form of photons, is created the frequency of the
photon is linearly proportional to the momentum.

It is also linearly proportional to the ??


Electrons and protons
=====================


Resonance
=========

Background
==========

Mean gravitational field, varies in time.

Time
====

??

Dark Matter
===========

Local areas of structure within the field, below the noise.

But you will get in sync if you pass by.


Quantum crypto
==============

Agreeing a local field structure below the noise.

Quantum computer
================

Look for structure in hidden field.

Space and time are different aspects of the same thing.

We can use time to put distance between us.

Food stores are already doing this with semi-formal 8-9am seniors only
rules.

Today I went out for a ride on the bike across Ottawa.

Barely any traffic, but small business after small business closed.

Small cafes, bars, restaurants, a bike shop, maps of the world.  All
closed.

I'm missing Bobby's after a winter of breakfasts on the way to the
hills.

It's now March 23rd, a day later.

Thoughts about how to distance in time.

How much is two metres in time?

Distracted by the bingo in Dublin.  Distance, time and distributed consensus.

Distance and time, different aspects of the same thing.

We can social distance with time too.

Imagine a community, 10 blocks in a city?  Along the same bus route?

What happens if only one tenth are outside each day?  And they stay
inside the other nine?

Today is day zero.  If your zip code ends in a 0, you get to go to
your place of choice within 10 minutes walking distance.

Tomorrow, will be day 1.  And so on, unless some event resets the
clock.

Such a strategy would need to be done alongside random testing to
allow tuning of the parameters and testing various hypotheses over
time.

I suspect it might be wise to rotate staff in sync with customers, so
a place might need ten shifts, based on the same codes.  So prepare to
be a trainee in case they are short when you visit.

For a school, often friends and siblings are at the same school.  So
do the day zero thing based on zip codes with families at schools and
teachers too.

Oh and don't let anyone near the chefs. 

Combine it all with random testing so you can tune it a little.

And add in noise of all sorts due to people misunderstanding the instructions.

If new infections are zero for long enough, allow two digits out each day.

But that's all a way down the road for now I'm afraid.

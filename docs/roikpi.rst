 Round Objects in Karma Pi
===========================

A tour of round objects of all kinds in karma pi land.

Modelling nested spheres.

Balls of all kinds, the World Cup of soccer too.

Using git to show how I develop code.

How ideas change and evolve over time.

Open data too and some ideas about decentralised systems.

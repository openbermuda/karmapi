 Round Objects in Karma Pi
===========================

A tour of round objects of all kinds in karma pi land.

Modelling nested spheres.

Balls of all kinds, the World Cup of soccer too.

Using git to show how I develop code.

How ideas change and evolve over time.

Open data too and some ideas about decentralised systems.

Breaking the rules.

the rules
---------

events: a time and a value

Everything else is meta data.

Code uses meta data to decide what to do with events.

breaking
--------

mix events with meta data

data in the data structures

helps understanding
-------------------

Get something tangible working.

Let it help you explore

Drinking from the hosepipe
--------------------------

Just time to record the events, with a few garbles?

fixing the code
---------------

taking away and re-moulding

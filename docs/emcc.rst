====================================
 Energy mass and the speed of light
====================================

$E = mc^2$

what does it mean?

Energy equals mass times the speed of light times the speed of light.

Energy:  will come back to that.

Mass: well it is a different form of energy.

Speed?  Oh well distance travelled divided by how long it took.  How
far you go in a unit of time.

Distance?  well you need a ruler.

Time? I guess a clock too.

Light.  Oh yes. Light.

Compared to a human, it travels very fast.  More distance in time than
anything else.

But for now let's pretend that c = 1.  Light travels a distance of 1
in a unit of time.

So light is a form of energy.

So think of energy as waves.

Each wave has a frequency, and an amplitude, tracing an S in an
infinite figure of eight.

And if the frequency is f then the energy is hf.

What is this h?

That is a constant, from Planck.

And we can use it to set a distance.  Let's pretent h = 1.

Then f is the energy too.

And it turns out that an energy of 1 creates a hole which collapses
and evaporates again in a fraction of time.

Now there is a unit of time, the Planck time, the time for light to
travel one Planck wavelength.

Recap
=====

Energy is another form of mass.

It is a wave with a frequency, the number of full waves in unit time.

Energy = frequency = mass.

Energy to mass
==============

Energy travels through space time at the speed of light, a single
wave, a packet.

Channeled by its own reflection from the fields it passes.

Mass is a warp in time, a place where energy has been captured, or
rather transformed to a different beat of time.

The background that was a harmony, modulated to a new harmonic.

That travels through time, but never catches light.

Unless it encounters a wave of disruption in the harmonic fabric of
time.

When a dance it may do and send light far beyond, sharing the energy,
working the harmony.

=======================
 Hare and the Tortoise
=======================

H: I am riding a wave at the edge of the universe.

T: I see.  I am riding the wave at the start of the universe.

T: Be careful out there, I hear you can just evaporate and enter
another universe.

H: Be careful back there, who knows when another black hole will
arrive.

T: Well when you evaporate, perhaps you can send a message, let me
know what it is like out there?

H: I might have to wait for other hares to join me, then maybe we can
send a message back.

T: I hear they are sending messages back all the time.

H: Below the noise?

T: Well it might actually be the noise.

H: Well I can't wait to see what is out there.

T: Well you might be disappointed.  All the action might be in here.

H: Well I've been racing along and whizzed by, nothing behind can
catch me up.

T: We'll get there eventually, probably long after you are gone.

H: Time flies, like my legs as they run.

T: Back here the rhythm is slower.  Same tune though.

T: Talking of tunes, did you hear about the neutrons?

H: Neutrons?  There are a fair few of those out here.

T: Well they have their own beat.

H: How hard do they beat?

T: Well that depends on the heat.

H: Heat, that's what I give off as I run.

T: Well yes, that is part of it.

T: The more heat, the stronger the beat.

H: So where does the heat come from?

T: Well it is sort of everywhere.

H: But what is it and how does it work?

T: Well it is ripples in time, that share the energy, share the work.

H: Ripple like the muscles in my legs?

T: Well back to neutrons.

H: What happens when they get cold?

T: Well the beat gets weaker, but never quite stops, unless
temperature gets to zero.

H: What about units?

T: Oh Planck units are good.

T: so if you create a wave with wavelength of 1, it collapses into a
black hole.

H: so it disappears?

T: well it is so much energy that it almost immediately evaporates.

H: so all that energy goes out in unit time, with me riding the wave?

T: but don't forget it evaporates too.

H: oh that's ok, just a little surf.

T: well yes and it comes right back at me.

H: you mean I am chasing my tail?

T: you are indeed, and pushing me along as you go.

H: like an infinite bottle of wine, that fills itself as you pour?

T: oh just like that, a magic vase from klein.

H: and Henry?  There must be a Henry there, Henry the hair.

T: Oh, like Tesla the tortoise?

H: Tesla?  no, Henry the hare.

T: There's Henry Poincare, he's just like a hare, with a tortoise
behind.

H: Have you been drinking the whine from klein?

T: you'd like Poincare, his magic disk.

H: what of this disk, what makes it glow?

T: well that would be the background buzz, the micro waves of fuzz.

H: so did Henri win the race to the end?

T: Well he showed that there are two ends you can have.

H: I get to choose if I win or lose?

T: Well I guess it is like that.

T: So paths which begin may one day rejoin, at the end of the run, at
the end of time.

H: so sounds like a draw and not a hair win.

T: well not a draw, but round again, with klein and wind, driven by
wine.

H: you said there was another way it might end.

T: well that does not end either, but you never get closer.  Forever
apart in the fabric of time.

H: and Tesla the tortoise?

T: Another time, another place.

Talking Numbers
===============

H: 0: racing along here, what's taking you so long?

T 1: it depends on the signal to noise ratio, how far we can go.

H 2:  I am ahead, you are behind.

T 3 = 1+1+1 = 1+2:  It depends which way you look at it.

And there are others to help.

So there's us two and Claude too,

or you and Claude and me watching you.

and me and Claude wathcing you.

H 4 = 2 * 2 = 2 + 2 = 2^2:   flying along here

two front two back

two left too right

too right too left

a back and a front

T 5 = v/ gravity is the thing that carries the waves around here.

Fast as light.   Well light is gravity.

Just a blip out of phase with the universe around, on a path to
yinfinity in a poincare space.

Prime here now, all in phase or pi away

H 6/ 

T 7=p/  All channels are modulated

filtered and amplified by the waves around

and the channels give feedback to.

Cancelling if out of phase

Amplifying if in phase

And in between, just nudging the phase.

Which way will it go?

H 8 = 2 * 2 * 2 = 2 * (2^2)/

T 9 = 3 * 3/ It is the local beliefs that modulate the signal

if in phase, the signal is strong

H 10 = 2 * 5/

T 11 = s/ 


H 12/

T 13=m/

H 14 = 2 * s/

T 15 = v * 3/

H 16 = 2 ^ 2 ^ 2 = (2 * 2) * (2 + 2)

Like a hare squared.

Pick your operators and multiply them together.

Now hare squared, that's some speed.

T 00 * 8/  And so on ad infinitum

Where according to poincare we will meet at infinity

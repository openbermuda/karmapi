=======================
 Hare and the Tortoise
=======================

H: I am riding a wave at the edge of the universe.

T: I see.  I am riding the wave at the start of the universe.

T: Be careful out there, I hear you can just evaporate and enter
another universe.

H: Be careful back there, who knows when another black hole will
arrive.

T: Well when you evaporate, perhaps you can send a message, let me
know what it is like out there?

H: I might have to wait for other hares to join me, then maybe we can
send a message back.

T: I hear they are sending messages back all the time.

H: Below the noise?

T: Well it might actually be the noise.

H: Well I can't wait to see what is out there.

T: Well you might be disappointed.  All the action might be in here.

H: Well I've been racing along and whizzed by, nothing behind can
catch me up.

T: We'll get there eventually, probably long after you are gone.

H: Time flies, like my legs as they run.

T: Back here the rhythm is slower.  Same tune though.

T: Talking of tunes, did you hear about the neutrons?

H: Neutrons?  There are a fair few of those out here.

T: Well they have their own beat.

H: How hard do they beat?

T: Well that depends on the heat.

H: Heat, that's what I give off as I run.

T: Well yes, that is part of it.

T: The more heat, the stronger the beat.

H: So where does the heat come from?

T: Well it is sort of everywhere.

H: But what is it and how does it work?

T: Well it is ripples in time, that share the energy, share the work.

H: Ripple like the muscles in my legs?

T: Well back to neutrons.

H: What happens when they get cold?

T: Well the beat gets weaker, but never quite stops, unless
temperature gets to zero.

H: What about units?

T: Oh Planck units are good.

============
 Matplotlib
============

It wasn't really a pull request.  Matplotlib was using svn back in 2004.

So it was create a patch with some mystical svn incantation, attach it
to and email and send it by email to John Hunter.

It was around 9am, in Dublin Ireland.

John was asleep in Chicago.

The day continued, working to get shiny new stacked bar graphs
working with data at work.

2pm Dublin, a message from Chicago.  Full of happiness and
encouragement.

Could ther be an example for the gallery?

Some hints about how to add tables, pointers where to look in the
code.

6.05pm train to Kildare.  Reading cell code.

6.50am Kildare to Dublin.   Writing table code.

Another patch to John.

2pm another email.  Happiness and encouragement.

A first patch.

Many years later
================

The tables always looked sad.  Fonts not making good use of the space.

Colours too, more needed.

A descent into freetype and artists and back to the table code.

It works Jim, but not as we know it.

Another patch, but this time with git, a pull request.

Can we have an example for the tests.

And discover image comparison tests,   Done.

A first matplotlib pull request

PS pull request in progress, refinements await.

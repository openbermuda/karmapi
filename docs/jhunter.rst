See the world flicker through the months as it warms and is bathed in sunlight.

This is an animation based on 40 years of climate reanalysis data.

The goal here is to fit models to this data and use these models to help provide better forecasts for future natural catastrophes.

In particular, hidden markov models will be fitted to the data to capture correlations in hazards across the globe and with luck  reveal underlying quasi -periodic drivers that modulate the climate. 

Karma Pi is a personal project where I explore data visualisation and simulation of all sorts.

From simulating the inners of black holes through the world's climate and even the FIFA soccer world club common themes emerge.

Nested spheres of data are at the core of much that is here.

Press 'p', 'j'

Let it run for a while.

You should have a bunch of png's in the folder where you ran this.

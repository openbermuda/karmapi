=============
 Revert Reds
=============

After a call to 311 the one at the end of my street seems to be
behaving a bit more predictably, which is good for me and others in
the area, but misses the heart of the problem.

Current traffic policy leans towards keeping the cars flowing.  Biking
about the city at present, it is startling how much space is given
over to cars and how much it impedes other means of travel.

The current city traffic management is inconsistent with the city's
declaration of a climate emergency and statement in the official plan
that it desires to raise use of active transport and transit.

Cycling across town the other day, down Somerset St.  It was a very
enjoyable ride, the streets were very quiet.

There are many lights along the route, hardly two share the same
protocols.

Pedestrians get head start, but not bikes.
  
Pedestrains and bikes both have their own symbols and get a head
start.

Plain old traffic light, pedestrian light just flashes, no counter.

Traffic like with pedestrian countdown.

Each junction is a little different, as we see how ideas have evolved
through projects over time.

Adding revert reds to this mix of light protocols is inviting
problems.

But overall, with current low traffic everything felt safe and
enjoyable.

The downtown is quiet, too quiet, the city is at a crossroads. How
to restore some vibrancy?




The city and the government might want to consider turning some
offices into public work spaces. A place you can go to do your remote
work, meet others doing similar work.

Business such as Shopify, now fully remote working, have excellent
office spaces which would be excellent co-working spaces.

Indeed Shopify is an interesting example, with its association with
open source software and communities.  

These communities have been collaborating on critical software bases
for over 30 years.  Our entire IT infrastructure is built on open
source.  And it was built through global collaboration facilitated by
the internet and tools the community built to support collaboration.

One tool, in particular, is worth special mention, if only for the
name, *git*, but that is likely another story.

The arrival of the pandemic and the work from home era has brought
this remote collaboration to large sectors of the population, albeit
with *zoom* and shared drives, cameras and mics.

Maybe even *git* for version control, more likely Dropbox, Drives or
whatever shared filespace is called these days.

The disruption has now been long enough that people have adapted to
the new normal and many rather like it.

Organisations too have adapted too.  I suspect the most successful
companies will be hybrid, with a decline in the demand for office
space.  But many will need a large space for occasional gatherings.

I would also expect that the move to remote has very much changed how
many organisations run, as people adapt to varying degrees and this
changes dynamics within an organisation.

Many were no doubt much more comfortable with the old world and are
hoping to a return.   In general, those exercising power and control
in organisations pre-pandemic may well have experienced significant
loss of control during all the change.

It is natural there will be many strong advocates for a return to
office commute.

How to resolve all this and re-vitalise the down town?

Well let's return to open source communities.  Whilst most
collaboration was done entirely on line, regular conferences were a
key part of the successful projects.

They gave opportunities for large numbers of individuals, typically
using some common tool to help them solve some other bigger problem,
to meet others wrestling with the same computation problems.

People from a wide variety of fields, gathering to share ideas was an
incredible incubator of ideas and stimulator of collaboration.

Working remotely can be very isolating, it was hard to find people
locally doing the same things.  Online communities turned into meetups
and mini conferences.

Back to the city, how to get people to want to go and visit there?

The key is surely to create spaces where people want to go because of
the others they will find there.  Whilst few want to spend 40 hours a
week plus 10 hours commuting, many would be happy with a couple of
afternoons, mornings or evenings a week.

In such work spaces it would be natural to have an extended working
day,  so the facility will be in use for more hours of the day and
commuting will be more evenly spread through the day.

As far as information technology is concerned, separation of civic
prigects into public, open projects versus internal private, projects
would be hugely beneficial.

The open parts of government could be co-located with the co-working
spaces.  Creating a unique opporunity to share ideas and increase
collaboration across the region, and share knowledge with each other.

For example, a space where those interested in the city's open data
portals can gather, and have those in the city working on the same
spend some time each week in the same space.

The city could allocate some of its spare office space to groups
interested in problems, such as the software controlling our traffic
lights.

Imagine there is a whole variety of spaces you can choosed to go to
work remotely for a while.  Not Jamaica, but rather the old city
offices where nobody wants to go.

We have just gone through the publishing of an official plan and it is
notably lacking of any evidence that any alternative futures have been
given proper consideration and evaluation.   This in light of
everything we have learnt through the pandemic.

Surely the city should be looking at some radically different visions
for transport and land use across the city?

There are no ends of projects where increased public contribution
would be invaluable.

Open up the planning department, organise regular lunch-and-learns
in the new shared space.  Truly, move to and being an open
organisation, designed as a place where the default is open to all.

Stop out-sourcing everything to consultants, rather build internal
expertise and collaboration across different local communities.

Create spaces where people can share there experiences during the
pandemic, how their outlook on the world may have changed and new
visions for the future.

Places where people can ask, what could we do if we reclaim some space
from cars?

Create the bike lanes where you don't stop rolling until you get where
you are going, pathways just merge and flow.

Instead of wondering if the capacitance of your statusesque existence
is stable enough to turn a light red as you wait for the inevitable
revert.

 A theory of waves in time
===========================


Forget everything you ever thought you knew about physics.

Well, not quite everything.

Bring with you everything you are sure you know.

How do you know you know?

Does this tell you something about the nature of information?

Does God play Dice?
===================

If so, how?


Wnere to begin?
===============

Our universe is likely littered with black holes colliding with each
other.

And this is now late in the day, just a billion years ago.

So, let's begin and guess that our universe may have been born when
two masses, each roughly half the mass of our universe, merged into a
giant black hole.

The two, ying and yang perhaps, merged throwing a ripple through the
time of space as the energy swirled inside, a new infinite harmony.

Waves of almost equal amplitude, in every integer frequency of a
driving beat of time.

The waves of energy would swirl like swirls of raspberry juice in a
bowl of custard.

Vortices will form, as waves pass by and swirl in harmony.

A tiny gyroscop of mass, resonating with anything sharing the
channel.

Energy is conserved, so harmony is rewarded.

self reference
==============

When a system is self-referential, everything and nothing is circular.

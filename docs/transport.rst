 Beyond the car
================

The car has shaped cities for many decades.

Giant highways linking cities of congestion.

Suburbs commuting to cities for work.

How about a re-think?


Cities
======

Great cities are easy to get around.

London and Paris, use the underground.

Netherlands, ride a bike.


Everything but the last mile
============================

For many journeys it is only the last mile or so where the roads have
a reasonable volume of traffic, say 10 vehicles per minute.

Let's build a network for the 10 per minute roads.

The idea is to have a hierarchy of connections.

Enter a pod, enter a destination and away you go.

Slowly downtown, as pods move around 15km, weaving with bikes, and
taking the podlift over junctions.

Synching with a collector that lifts the pod into the maglev network.

For a short journey just stay in the pod, you'll be sent down the
slippage towards your destination.

If you're on a bike, but with further to go, try a bike pod.

Or take one of the routes that has bike antigravity assist.

And if you are on foot then you can walk through all of town without
having to wait for vehicles.

The last mile
=============

Downtown, 10 block areas.

Bikes, pedestrians and low speed (15-20km/h) lightweight vehicles.

Magic shuttles 20km/h no stops.

No door problems.

Experiment with winter routes which take advantage of snow and ice.

Dual: bike/ski routes?   At least one should be good.



How to get from here to there?

Pots
====

Software is malleable, just like clay.

Start out with an idea, a magic pot, something to make from clay.

Start doing what you think might get you there.

Learn clay doesn't work that way.

Or it does until it gets hot in the kiln.

Along the way you notice a bunch of other cool things about clay.

And your magic pot vision changes

Since you now have new tricks in the tool kit.

An artist with tools of many colours.

Software
========

Someone else is has a very specific design for a pot they want you to build.

They do not care that you can build something a 100 times better than their
design in lots of dimensions much more easily than you can build the
object of their desire.

They also say what tools you can use to build the pot.

And the pot must be fired in their kiln

which is heated by a fire breathing dragon 

which randomly kicks the kiln around like a football or tosses it in
the air, breathes fire on it then heads it to the ground.

Free Software Pots
==================

Artisan software.

Someone follows their own ideas.

Finds something interesting.

Offers it to others, who can each take their own path.

Or like a band of artists weave rhythms and themes.

Each with their own dance but creating ripples

And waves to the future

With a commit log story

Of how we got here.

With hints at the paths that might have been taken

An infinite tree of exploration.

Sharing the general.

Generalising until all that differs is data

And any good Turing complete will do.

 Distance and time with bicycles
=================================

There is a lot of good information in this article, particular in
regards to how c19 seems to be spreading::

  https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/22/health/coronavirus-restrictions-us.html

Outbreaks tend to be family groups, friends, people who work together,
a restaurant or cafe.

Transmission seems to be greater in groups which spend more time
together.  My guess (and it is a guess) is most (90%?) infections come
from airborn transmission.

We breath out a large amount of virus, very much larger amounts when
we cough.   The amount that transmits between two people drops rapidly
with distance, but increases significantly when in close proximity for
a large amount of time.

Atmospheric conditions such as extreme cold, wind, humidity, warmth
may significantly affect transmission.   Is there existing research in
this area?

I hope someone is researching outdoor versus indoor transmission
rates for c19, although recognise this is challenging to do.

For outdoor rates, the atmospheric conditions would seem relevant.

Indoor, we are being told 2 metres apart, so let's go with that
outside, or raise it to 5m when we can.

Large food stores are currently the largest gatherings.

It would seem this is an area where more segmenting of customers would
help.  For example, each day say which digits (last digit of a
Canadian post code?) get to go shopping.

For the other days how about contact free bicycle delivery?

Attach a trolley to your bike and you're part of bike net.

Ride your bike to a loading area.

Someone loads the cargo.

Off you go.

Divide the city into grids.

Use traffic lights to synchronise movement through loading areas.

In between a grid of traffic free bicycle priority lanes with a 5 metre
rule.

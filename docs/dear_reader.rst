========================
 To whom it may concern
========================

I have had the wonderful privelege to spend much of the last month in
my back yard in Bermuda, by a beautiful crystal clear pool, with views
down to the sea and up to the lighthouse that shines over the land.

Nobody seems to want me to work for them.   I can't really blame them,
I draw energy from those around, like a mini black hole in my own
little universe.

There are flares and spouts of fire.  Waves of unimaginable beauty.

But if you are too close, or on a different wave, it hits you like a
Mersenne prime from the mysts of time.

So, back by the pool.

I have water, lots of water.


A table, an umbrella.  As the young child told me at the lighthouse,
you need an umbrella.

And a hosepipe, but a pool noodle might do.

And bottles.

Klein ones two, a twisted infinite figure of eight.

Pools too.  Pools connected by waves through the tubes of time.

And magnets too, driven by wheels in the sky.



I am just sitting here watching the wheels go by

As the moai walk straight down the pool

But there straight is a spiral, an infinite moebus figure of eight.


The clouds they pass by, a breeze in the air.

The rhythm of black holes away in the sea.

As they swirl and they dance to the rhythm of the numbers as they
dance themselves.

An infinite figure of eight.


The rain it may fall

Drops dance in the pool

An infinite swirl of rhythm and dance.

When the rain it does end and the clouds they do clear

The pool is a shimmer, with waves here and thither.

As the music of the moai gains another harmonic.

In time it does settle, to the beat of the moai

As the blue sky on high brings peace once again.

But what of the black hole,

And the dark matter that glows to the rhythm of old?

Is the music that enters that which leaves too?

And the rhythm of all the zeros of Riemann?

And so this is my story.

A whole in the dark, building the rhythm

Learning the music of life

And as it uncoils, the music goes out

To the matter beyond

In a shared harmony

A finite mass, preserves the mana.

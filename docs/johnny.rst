Made in Sheffield, or thereabouts.

Studied mathematics at Warwick University

Then went to work with computers with the government.

Which brought me to Ottawa and a whole new adventure.

This of natural catastrophes, particularly Atlantic hurricanes.

With time in Ireland and round in circles.

With more computers, linux and python.

Now back in Ottawa, third time lucky.

Along the way many adventures.

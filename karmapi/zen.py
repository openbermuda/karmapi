Many years agp Tim Peters wrote "The Zen of Python".

It was turned into a module. 

If you "import this" you get the Zen of Python.

If you are running *eric* or *IDLE* then just "Control-m", it should prompt you for a module name.

Enter *this* and it should show you the code for the *this* module.

pint
====

A few days back we talked about assigning pi points, or pints for short to things we could do here. 

For now they don't really exist in any real fashion, just imaginary.

zen
===

A blockchain that gives zen for karma.

Initial mining by a network of pi's.

Update
======

Fast forward six months.  New inspiration from Alvarro Boirac.

So the idea here is to have a blockchain for every stream of data.

The trick is to find streams that other people also want to see, share the work
and the trust.

The blockchain can log blocks of data, and meta data about that data.

A block server too.  Get the blocks you need for the problems that interest you.

Share your results.

Share observations, numbers in time.

And model predictions too.

Use blockchain to sign the data blocks.  An open ledger of open data.

Copyright of data and other IP.
===============================

Many organisations have invaluable data that can aid research at a time when
more than ever there is a need to understand how our planet works.   

Earthquake records, give detailed data on magnitude depth latitude, longitude and time.

Data related to climate modelling and forecasting is freely available from
organisations such as the European Centre for Medium Range Weather forecasting.

The aim of this project here is to enable those sharing such data to share the
work of distributing and exploring that data and to feed back their discoveries too.

The dream is that organisations will adopt something like this as a way to
share data and information in a network of open trust.

For now, the goal is get a simple working example.  Famous last words.

CPR: show time universe

Simulate nested spherical waves.

Things have moved on a little.

So each ball of nested waves will have a driver at the inside and at the
outside too.

Different clocks at each layer.

And then outer layers made up of other randomly placed nested spheres.

But using a universal queue, so let each sphere run in its own co-routine.

Update: 2018/8/4
================

The Sphere and NestedWaves classes are moving along.

For now, a sphere is represented by a square grid.

We can decide later where the grid points lie.

I have been experimenting with grids multiples of primes and made a few code
changes moving it closer to *anpotu*.

Some interesting patterns emerging::

   python3.6 cpr --base 0 --inc 23 -n 7

Update: 2018/8/9

The motivation for using grids with prime dimensions was that it makes it makes
it challenging for the spheres to stay in sync with each other.

Their periods are co-prime.

As a result, spirals emerge.

In the initial runs there was a strong diagonal property developing.

A smooth, square, space in the top left corner.

A more random square bottom right, with the corners of these two squares meeting.

Much symmetry for the bands to the top and left of the view.

My interpretation is these bands show the layers largely being in sync.

Regardless, another view of these grids is to view them from the north or south
pole.  When you do that there are spirals everywhere.

Feedback from the user base
===========================

::

    The problem with all these new settings is that my computer can't manage
    with a high enough base setting to get reasonably smooth output.
    Eventually it all seizes up!  You either need to run on a much faster
    machine or simplify the code.  The previous code before all these later
    releases was much better in this respect.  I could set base to 137 and get
    a fairly responsive output.  

    But it's all very interesting.  

    You still haven' t told me what it has to do with the new paradigm!  (Apart
    from the 1/r decay).  C


The performance has been bugging me too.

I made some changes in how the spheres update and now they are busy hogging the
cpu.  I'm working towards spreading the work across processors.  

Ironically, there's a python thing called the GIL in the way -- but that is
another story. [YOSSER]

Re: the paradigm.  Up to now I have pretty much been debugging the code.

Puzzling over why the images were like they were, fixing up the code along the
way.  

Once I have the code stable again (?) the next phase is to embed these spheres
in a *celestial sphere*, summing the fields per de Sciama.

Again, to begin with I will ignore all the physics and code something up that
we can then add some reality (?) to it once I have it working.

I expect the paradigm to be more evident in this part of the code.

Another thing to keep in mind it is easy to add new types of spheres: a quasar
with an accretion belt for example.

I am also hoping there will be some *emergent* behaviour in the code, maybe
even galaxies spawning new ones.

======

So for now I am running each tick of a sphere by having curio spawn a thread.

Let's change that to run in process.

So what does it have to do with the Colin Rourke's new paradigm?
================================================================

*A new paradigm on the universe.*

https://msp.warwick.ac.uk/~cpr/paradigm

ISBN: 9781973129868

I am currently reworking my way through the first five chapters of the book.

It is the third or fourth time through, each time with new understanding.

It is a wonderful work, with compelling arguments.

Chapter 2, Sciama's principle finishes with:

   Sciama's initiative, to base a dynamical theory on Mach's principle as
   formulated i Sciama's principle, has never been followed up and this
   approach to dynamics remains dormant.  One of the aims of this book is to
   reawaken this approach.

One of the aims of karma pi is to help understanding of such theories.

In particular, help my own understanding with computer simulations.

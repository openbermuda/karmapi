A default backend.

Or a new beginning?

After many adventures, let's go with simple Tk, with a twist.

Just display the latest image from the deque.

pigfarm: Space Yard PillBox and MagicCarpet

   Space the base

   Yard with at Canvas as an artist

   PillBox: goal is a PIL.Image as artist

   MagicCarpet:
       matplotlib and pandas world???

All come with different artists.

pipig will focus on PIL, images, grids of data, often spherical.

With the Canvas conversion to an image can be problematic.  

The PIL.Draw api is rich enough for karma pi needs and on a par with the canvas
api, so I don't need both here, let's stick to images.

matplotlib will return images that can be similarly displayed, so I think we
may be good.

Whereas adding an image to tk for display purposes is (relatively) seamless (?)

So on the python side then PIL, or rather pillow

Grids or projections from spheres
